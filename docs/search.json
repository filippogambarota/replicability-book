    "text": "1.1 Replication, Robustness and Reproducibility\nThis book is concerned with what we call the three “R”’s of trustworthy science: Replication, Robustness and Reproducibility. We begin by sketching a definition of each. This first Chapter then elaborates on the definition of replicability more specifically.\nIn 2019 the USA’s National Academies published a report on Reproducibility and Replicability in Science (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine et al., 2019), which we strongly recommend as a complementary reading to this document. They propose to define Replicability as “obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data”. This will be our first “R”. The NAS definition is also endorsed by the American Statistical Association (Broman et al., 2017) and generally adopted in statistics (for example (Heller et al., 2014) add a couple of review papers).\nThe second “R” is Reproducibility, defined by NAS as “obtaining consistent results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, and code, and conditions of analysis” (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine et al., 2019). Here the experimental design, data and methodologies of analysis are all fixed. A reproducible research paper should provide enough information to obtain the results originally reported, starting from the same raw data. Raw data are data in a form as close as possible to what was generated by the original experimental source. Defining precisely what raw data is can be complex both conceptually and practically, but a digression on this would take us too far astray. Nowadays it is becoming more common to supplement a paper with analysis code, raw data (if possible) and details or materials (e.g., experimental stimuli, biological reagents, questionnaires) about the experimental setup. Reproducibility can be considered as the most fundamental pre-requisite of replication in science. Chapter will provide a more detailed explanation of the concept with an overview of tools for doing reproducible science.\nOur third “R” also involves keeping the raw data fixed, and focuses on changing parts of the analysis method. This is different from the previous two, as it investigates the robustness of the results to the many judgment calls that typically need to be made in the implementation of a statistical analysis. Chapter 6 will present some methods for investigating robustness. For example, multiverse analysis (e.g., Steegen et al., 2016) is a way to systematically sample different plausible analytical strategies and see their impact on the final conclusions.\nUsage of the first two “R” terms is often inconsistent; and, it is reversed in computer science. (Barba, 2018; Goodman et al., 2016; Kenett & Shmueli, 2015) review these terminologies and their usage.",

    "section": "1.2 Defining Replication",
    "text": "1.2 Defining Replication\n\n1.2.1 Challenges\nWhen studying, planning or conducting studies about replication in science, it is essential to start from a clear definition and formalization of replication. First we need to define when an experiment or study constitutes a replication attempt of another.\nA gray area often arises where scientists attempt to replicate the results of a study using a similar but not identical scientific methodology. If they obtain a different result, should they conclude that the new study did not replicate the original? To answer, the replication needs to be evaluated not only in terms of its result; but, also with regard to the study design — for example, with regard to whether experimental factors, approaches and conditions are the same or different. In this first chapter we discuss the design of a replication study from both an empirical and a philosophical perspective.\nThe statistical analysis and the evaluation of whether replication was successful will be covered in Chapter 4, where we will discover that there can be several different definitions of what a successful replication is. Anderson & Kelley (2024) reviewed more than 20 different replication criteria and Heyard et al. (2024) identified more than 50 published statistical approaches to assess a replication experiment.\nWe begin by reviewing concepts that in our view are general enough to be applied to multiple research areas and translated into an empirically testable statistical framework. The bibliography for this chapter contains a selected list of theoretical papers on replication.\n\n\n1.2.2 Cronbach’s essential components of an experiment\nWe start by defining the essential components of an experiment as proposed by Cronbach & Shapiro (1982)1 His framework is concisely referred to as UTOS because it consisted of these four components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUTOS Framework\n\n\n\n\nUnits: the elements of the population from which the study sample has been drawn; the term population is used here in its statistical sense: a real or hypothetical universe of units (not necessarily persons) to which the inferential conclusions of the study should apply;\nTreatments: the independent variables, for example experimental interventions, or population subgroups of interest;\nOutcomes: the dependent variables on which the study is focused\nSetting: the remainder of factors that can affect the experimental outcome and its relation to treatments. For example the factors defining the “environment” where a psychological experiment takes place (lab vs online experiment, cultural aspects, etc.)\n\n\n\nSome initial comments:\n\nU: this component positions us unequivocally in the territory of statistical inference, where we posit a population of reference consisting of distinct units, and we are interested in generalizing from an observed sample to the entire population. Naturally not all science aligns with this paradigm. Before reading further, try to think about important scientific studies you may have come across recently that do not fit with this paradigm.\nT & O: these components implicitly assume that the goal of the study was to elucidate how, in the population of interest, the outcomes relate to the independent variables, perhaps causally, if the experiment is controlled. Again, this is an important subset of science, but is by no means exhaustive. Clustering, discovery of latent dimensions in high dimensional data, segmentation of images, and a number of other exceptions come to mind. Add your own. Also, important science can be simply exploratory and descriptive, but replicability questions are relevant there as well.\nS: By changing settings “minimally” you get “essentially” the same experiments. For example you may change the temperature in the lab for an experiment where temperature is a negligible factor. On the other hand, if you change the temperature in a chemistry experiment where a certain reaction is very sensitive to temperature, you may get a completely different experiment and arguably a different study: skating on ice vs water, so to speak. So it takes a little sprinkle of common sense for this to be a useful definition. Be alert.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Machery’s definition of a replication experiment\nMachery (2020) proposed a simple and flexible perspective on replication called the resampling account.\nConsider an original experiment in the UTOS framework, and imagine we can sharply specify fixed and random factors in the following sense: a random factor can be thought of as sampled from the population of interest, while a fixed factor is not sampled, but rather determined by design. For example, participants (Units) can be assumed to be random when the study samples a group of participants according to a well defined sampling scheme. In contrast, an experimental manipulation is generally fixed. Random sampling affords to option to use statistical inference to learn parameters of the population of interest (see also Yarkoni, 2020 for the idea of generalizability). Stricltly speaking, inference using a fixed factor is limited only to the tested condition. Defining fixed and random factors in real settings can be complex. Challenges and approaches are extensively debated in the literature (e.g., Clark & Linzer, 2015).\nReturning to replication, according to Machery, a replication experiment is an experiment created by sampling from the random factors (e.g., new group of participants), and keeping the non-random factors fixed (e.g., same type of drug or treatment). In this definition, population parameters of interest are identical between an original study and its replication. We will return on this point in Chapter 3.\nA replication experiment is meant to assess what Machery calls reliability. Machery (2020) uses the term reliability as in measurement theory (Tal, 2020) where a reliable instrument (in this case the experiment is seen as the instrument) produces consistent 2 results across different replications of the measurement. When replicating a whole experiment, say sampling a new sample of participants, we are similarly interested in evaluating whether the experimental setup is reliable in the sense of producing consistent results.\nAs an illustration of the measurement metaphor, imagine a treatment for depression that has been evaluated in an original study. The researchers developed a protocol, defined the concept of depression, administered the treatment and chose some depression self-report measures, finding a decreasing level of depression compared to the control group. Another group of researchers decided to replicate this original experiment. They adopted the same protocol, definitions and measures but collected another sample of participants from the same population. The results of the replication experiment, for example the magnitude of the effect of the treatment on the depression level as defined by the protocol, may or may not be close to the original. If they are close, this provides evidence in favor of the reliability of the original experiment, as defined above (Nosek & Errington, 2017). Here, we are not questioning the definition or the measures used in the study.\nTo recap the progress made so far, if you can frame a study as UTOS, and clearly separate the random and fixed factors, you know how to design a replication study!",

    "section": "1.3 Validity and Extensions",
    "text": "1.3 Validity and Extensions\n\n1.3.1 Conceptual Replication\nDoes is make sense to compare experiments when fixed factors have changed? In many cases it does, and this type of analysis still falls under the purview of replication, broadly construed. Readers familiar with the replication literature may have noticed that we did not use concepts such as direct or conceptual replication yet. Briefly, a direct replication is usually defined as an experiment that tries to recreate the original experiment as closely as possible. While this objective can be achieved in some fields, it is typically empirically challenging, due to uncontrollable factors (Nosek & Errington, 2017, 2020). Examples include replicating effects that are strongly culturally dependent, or experiments that used a completely outdated technology for the experimental setup.\nIn contrast, conceptual replication is a broad term defining a replication experiment with similar aims and methodology but with important differences (e.g., Crandall & Sherman, 2016). In Machery’s terms, a conceptual replication changes some of the fixed factors. In the depression example above, a conceptual replication might be a second experiment using another theoretical definition or measure of depression. Here, the goal is still within the broad umbrella of understanding the effect of the treatment on depression, but the experiment is not a strict replication in the Machery sense, because the outcome measurement methodology has changed. For this reason Machery (2020) uses the term extension. Extensions may include a methodological change but also a more profound philosophical change, for example using a scale motivated by a different theoretical framework for defining depression. An extension of an experiment is not assessing the reliability, but rather the validity of the original experiment and in a broader sense the theory underlying the original experiment. Similarly to reliability, the term validity is used with measurement theory in mind. The validity of a measurement involves correspondence with the true phenomenon being assessed (for example, the actual weight of an object being weighed).\nIn the depression example, if the researchers want to see whether the treatment is effective also using other measures of depression they are extending the original results; and, thereby, testing the validity of the result about the treatment.\n\n\n1.3.2 Precision of Replication\nIn practice we can often design a variety of replication / extension experiments, with varying degrees of similarity with the original one. Rosenthal (1990) defines the important concept of precision as the degree of similarity between the replication and the original experiment. The most precise is a Machery replication. Generally, very precise experiments lack external validity (they are not able to extend) but they can directly speak to the reliability of the original experimental setup and results. Less precise experiments will provide weaker evidence regarding the original experiment, shifting the focus to our confidence in the underlying theory. For example, we may say that the treatment also reduces physiological indexes of depression or is also effective in a different population of patients.\n\n\n1.3.3 Replication vs Extension: different scientific value?\nWe have seen that a precise replication experiment is an attempt to ask the same inferential question in as simlar a way as possible. Variations in setting and fixed factors can generate experiments that probe the trustworthiness of the conclusions further. These slight variations can be successfully analyzed together with replicability in mind, for example in a meta-analysis (see Chapter 5), even though they do not constitute a strict replication by Machery’s exacting standards.\nAs settings are varied further and the replication becomes less precise, we eventually find ourselves having extended the experimental paradigm beyond the initial goals and populations. When is this line crossed? The answer to this question is dependent on the context; and, reasonable scientists may disagree about it. An important debate in the literature regards the value of a replication, as compared to an extension, of an experiment. Crandall & Sherman (2016) considers extensions as more valuable while Simons (2014) argues in favor of focusing on replications of experiments. Clearly both have a place in science. If the main aim is to test the reliability of the original experiment one should reduce the heterogeneity (i.e., increase the precision) as much as possible. On the other hand, if the aim is to explore different instances of the same effect or theory, one should extend the experimental setup.\nIn the remainder of the discussion we will use precise replication to denote a replication experiment in the strict sense of Machery, or a sufficiently close approximation, while we use the word extension to describe replication settings where the precision is lower. The appropriate definition of a successful replication, and the proper choice of statistical methodlogy for analyzing data may vary greatly, depending on where the follow-up study falls on this precision continuum.\n\n\n1.3.4 Contextual dependency\nContextual dependency (Gollwitzer & Schwabe, 2022; Inbar, 2016; Van Bavel et al., 2016) further develops the Machery (2020) framework by considering specific weights assigned to each UTOS element. Without going into details, the impact of the different UTOS elements on the actual experiment could differ according to the type of research question. For example, consider a social psychology experiment originally conducted on Western American participants and later extended to European or Asian participants. If the psychological construct of interest is strongly affected by cultural variations, the impact of changing the ethnicity may be considerable. In contrast, a lab-based experiment about low-level perceptual effects may be more portable across culturally diverse populations. Our expectations about the replication/extension outcome need to be calibrated with respect to the specific research question at hand, and the impact of each experimental element.\n\n\n1.3.5 Investigators as a Factor\nAs a final note, one important but often underestimated problem concerns the investigators conducting the replication study or studies. They can legitimately be considered part of the setting in some cases; but, they can be seen as random or irrelevant in others. Rosenthal (1990) clearly described the problem of correlated replicators and proposed different weighting approaches, based on the design of the replication study, for replication/extension studies conducted from authors that are orthogonal in terms of background theory and methods. Authors sharing a theory or a strict network of co-authorships are likely to create experiments and data that are more similar compared to independent authors. A replication or extension study conducted by an independent, and possibly skeptical, researcher should have a greater impact on increasing or decreasing confidence in the original findings, as compared to a follow-up study conducted by the original author.",

The notation is based on the replication model by Pawel & Held (2020) and the meta-analytical notation by Hedges & Schauer (2021), Schauer & Hedges (2021), and Hedges & Schauer (2019).\nWe use \\(x\\)’s to denote predictors, treatments, and fixed factors, and \\(y\\)’s to denote outcomes. The subscript \\(i\\) denotes individuals within a study, while \\(r\\) indexes studies. We use \\(r=0\\) to denote the original study, and \\(r = 1, 2, \\ldots, R\\) to denote the \\(R \\geq 1\\) replication studies.\nWe use the greek letter \\(\\theta\\)’s to define the true effects for the original and replication study(s). These are population parameters. In particular \\(\\theta_0\\) is the effect in original study and \\(\\theta_r\\) is the effect in the \\(r\\)-th study. In principle, \\(\\theta\\)’s can be vector valued, but for simplicity we will focus on a scalar effect. We will also use other greek letters for parameters specific to individual settings.\nThe one-to-one replication design is used when a single replication study is replicating an original experiment. On the other hand, a replication project with \\(R\\) replication studies is called a one-to-many design.\nIn Chapter 1 we covered the Machery definition of replication, in which only the randomly drawn subjects differ between the original study and the replications. In a replication of this type, the population of reference remains the same, an therefore \\(\\theta_0 = \\theta_1 = \\ldots = \\theta_R\\). This will be the case with Miller’s original, for example. Generally, in a highly precise replication, this will also be approximately correct.\nOn the other hand, if we consider a group of extension experiments, or even more broadly examine an entire field of research, we typically alter fixed factors, and thus consider many different, albeit related, populations. In this case \\(\\theta\\)’s are no longer identical. Variation between \\(\\theta\\)’s is an important aspect of replicability analysis. We will return to it in several places. For now, consider that this variation depends on the unverse of studies of interest. For example, a group of extension experiments for a specific treatment / outcome combination will generally have smaller variability than a group considering the effect of the same treatment on a variety of outcomes.\n\n3.1.3 Two-Level Models\nOne way to think about studying the variation of the \\(\\theta\\)’s is to frame the analysis in a two-level model. Within a study, we imagine that subjects are drawn from a population, with each population associated with a specific study design / fixed factors. In turn, then, study designs themselves are seen as draws from a hypothetically vast collection of possible designs. This allows to describe the variation of \\(\\theta\\)’s probabilistically. In many examples we will use a Normal distribution to describe the resulting population of effect sizes. This normal distribution will have mean \\(\\mu_{\\theta}\\) and variance \\(\\tau^2\\).\nReplication is often framed in terms of tests of hypothesis. Parenthetically, several fields of study are making organized attempts at moving scientific reporting away from tests of hypotheses (Harrington et al., 2019). Evidential summaries from hypothesis tests, such as p-values, systematically confound sample size and effect size (Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016). Better reporting focuses on quantitative effect sizes. Nonetheless, replicability analysis requires explicit consideration of significance, as this remains a factor in determining publication.\nHere we will define the null hypothesis to be that “the effect is too small to be of scientific interest”. Formally, the null hypothesis is true when \\(|\\theta| &lt; h_0\\) where \\(h_0\\) is specified by the analyst and defines a so-called region of practical equivalence or ROPE (Kruschke, 2015; Kruschke & Liddell, 2018)1. In a precise replication, \\(\\theta\\) does not change across studies and thus the null hypothesis is either true or not in every study. In contrast, if we consider a group of extension experiments or a whole field, \\(\\theta\\)’s vary and the null hypothesis may hold in some studies and not others. We will use \\(\\pi\\) to denote the proportion of non-null effect in a population of studies.\nMiller (2009) noted that \\(\\pi\\) is an unknown quantity that is difficult to estimate from the literature. In Psychology, Wilson & Wixted (2018) tried to estimate \\(\\pi\\) based on the Collaboration & Open Science Collaboration (2015) large scale replication project finding different rates for social and cognitive psychology. In a similar vein, Jager & Leek (2014) tried to estimate the false discovery rate across the top medical journals.\nThe more precise the replication, the smaller will \\(\\tau\\) be. As \\(\\tau\\) goes to zero, all \\(\\theta\\)’s will concentrate around \\(\\mu_{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\pi\\) will approach either 0 or 1 depending on whether \\(\\mu_{\\theta}\\) is in the region of practical equivalence.\nFigure 3.1 depicts this simple generating model. The idea is that true effects in a given research area \\(\\theta_r\\) comes from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) and standard deviation \\(\\tau\\). Within this research area, we have a certain proportion of true \\(\\pi\\) and false \\(1 - \\pi\\) effects. In case of false effects, we can imagine a ROPE in which the effects are assumed to be equal to zero. Then these true effects \\(\\theta_r\\) can be the target of an original study \\(\\hat \\theta_0\\) and one or more replication studies \\(\\hat \\theta_r\\) (\\(r = (1, \\ldots, R)\\)). If the study is a precise replication study the heterogeneity is expected to be close to zero while in an extension experiment we are expecting more heterogeneity. To simplify, the expected heterogeneity of a very precise replication is zero and all studies are essentially estimating the same original true effect \\(\\theta_0\\). In cases where the heterogeneity is different from zero (i.e., an extension) each replication study is associated with a different underlying true effect \\(\\theta_r\\). The degree of heterogeneity is related to the degree of precision, viz., the number and relevance of changes to fixed factors. This model can be considered similar to a random-effects meta-analysis (described in Chapter XXX). The model can also be used to simulate replication studies as will be shown in Chapter XXX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: two level generating model\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Multi-level Model\nFigure 3.1 provides an example of a generating model for a specific research area in the literature, e.g., the distribution of true effects related to psychological treatments for depression. Some treatments in some conditions will have a higher/lower effect and in other conditions they will have a null effect. Extending the same reasoning to multiple effects within a broader literature, we can include another hierarchical layer in the model. Figure 3.2 depicts this extended model. To simplify we can have the treatments for depression and anxiety. These research areas have specific average effects \\(\\mu_\\theta^1, \\mu_\\theta^2\\), heterogeneity \\(\\tau^1, \\tau^2\\) and proportions of true \\(\\pi^1, \\pi^2\\) and false \\(1 - \\pi^2, 1 - \\pi^2\\) effects. The combinatons of the two research areas define the broader literature defined as a mixture of the two distributions. Each component (i.e., anxiety and depression distributions) is associated with a weight \\(\\omega^1, \\omega^2\\) representing the importance (e.g., prevalence of studies) in the final mixture distribution. As a final note, instead of considering \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) as fixed, we can sample these values from two distributions generating a more realistic research area contanining a larger set of true effects. In terms of replication, we can apply the same logic of Figure 3.1 where the degree of precision determines the expected heterogeneity in the replication/extension study.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Mixture generating model\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Simple Null Hypotheses\nMiller (2009) and many other works in the literature are concerned with simple null hypotheses. In our notation the null hypothesis is true when \\(|\\theta| = 0\\). The logic of section Section 3.1.3 can be cloned for this case as well, as illustrated in Figure Figure 3.3. Now the distribution of \\(\\theta\\) has two components: a continuous component describing the variation of the effect assuming the effect is not zero, and a discrete component at exactly zero. The probability of drawing a nonzero effect will again be \\(\\pi\\), which is also the area under the bell curve in the figure. Thus the point mass at zero is \\(1-\\pi\\). In terms of replication, we can apply the same logic of Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 where the degree of precision determines the expected heterogeneity in the replication/extension study.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Point null generating model",

    "text": "3.2 Probability of Replication in Exact Replication Experiments\n\n3.2.1 Two-Sample Design Review\nWe will often use a two-sample design to make the discussion more concrete. Assuming the homogeneity of variances among the two groups, the \\(t\\) statistic is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2}{SE_{\\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2}}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nwhere subscripts denote the two groups. The standard error at the denominator is: \\[\n\\mbox{SE}_{\\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2} = s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nwhere \\(s_p\\) is the pooled standard deviation: \\[\ns_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_{y_1}(n_1 - 1) + s^2_{y_1}{(n_2 - 1)}}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nIn the case of a simple null hypothesis, the p-value can be calculated from a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(\\nu = n_1 + n_2 - 2\\) degrees of freedom.\nMore generally, when the true effect size is not zero, the \\(t\\) statistic will follow a non-central Student’s \\(t\\) distribution with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter \\(\\lambda\\), calculated as follows: \\[\n\\lambda = \\delta \\sqrt{\\frac{n_1 n_2}{n_1 + n_2}}\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta\\) is the true effect size — the true difference between means divided by the true group specific standard error.\nIf \\(F_{t_\\nu}\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the non-central Student’s \\(t\\) distribution, the statistical power is calculated as:\n\\[\n1 - \\beta = 1 - F_{t_\\nu} \\left(t_c, \\lambda \\right) + F_{t_\\nu} \\left(-t_{c}, \\lambda \\right)\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nWith this setup, we can easily implement these equations in R, thus creating a flexible set of functions to reproduce and extend the examples from Miller (2009).\n\npower.t &lt;- function(d, n1, n2 = NULL, alpha = 0.05){\n    if(is.null(n2)) n2 &lt;- n1\n    df  &lt;- n1 + n2 - 2\n    ncp &lt;- d * sqrt((n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2))\n    tc  &lt;- abs(qt(alpha/2, df = df))\n    pt(-tc, df = df, ncp = ncp) + pt(tc, df = df, ncp = ncp, lower.tail = FALSE)\n}\n\n\npower.t(d = 0.5, n1 = 30)\n## [1] 0.4778965\npower.t(d = 0.5, n1 = 100)\n## [1] 0.9404272\npower.t(d = 0.1, n1 = 200)\n## [1] 0.1694809\n\nWhen the null hypothesis is a set (section Section 3.1.3) the p-value is calculated conditional on the least favorable case, which occurs when \\(\\theta = h_0\\) or \\(\\theta = - h_0\\), so the noncentral \\(t\\) is used to compute both the p-value and the power.\nAnother possibility is to use the full ROPE for the statistical test within the so-called equivalence testing framework (Lakens et al., 2018; see also Goeman et al., 2010 for the three-sided hypothesis testing).\n\n3.2.2 The Calculus of Replication Probabilities\nConsider the case of strict replication, so the null hypothesis is true or false in both studies at the same time.\nTo prepare for Miller (2009), we look at replication probability by focusing on replicating significance. Given that the original study was significant (that is that \\(|t_0| &gt; t_{c_0}\\)), what is the probability that the second study will also be significant and the effect will be in the same direction as the original study? Formally we express significance in the original study as \\(|t_0| &gt; t_{c_0}\\), significance in the replication study as \\(|t_1| &gt; t_{c_1}\\), and concordance of the direction of the effect as \\(t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt; 0\\).\n\\[\np_{rep} = \\Pr(|t_1| &gt; t_{c_1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 \\boldsymbol{\\mid} |t_0| &gt; t_{c_0})\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nUsing the laws of conditional and total probability in turn, We can express this as\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\np_{rep} &= \\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c_1} \\boldsymbol{\\mid} |t_0| \\geq t_{c_0}) \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\frac{\\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c_1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 \\cap |t_0| \\geq t_{c_0})}{\\Pr(|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0})} \\\\[10pt]\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nConsiderering separately the numerator and the denominator, and using the law of total probability, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mbox{numerator} =& \\Pr(H_1) \\cdot \\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 \\cap |t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} \\mid H_1) + \\\\\n& \\Pr(H_0) \\cdot \\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 \\cap |t_0| \\geq t_{c0} \\mid H_0) \\\\[10pt]\n\\mbox{denominator} =& \\Pr(H_1) \\cdot \\Pr(|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} \\mid H_1) + \\\\\n& \\Pr(H_0) \\cdot \\Pr(|t_0| \\geq t_{c_1} \\mid H_0).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.8}\\]\nThese expressions are a bit cumbersome, but they allow us to express the probability of replication as a useful function of power and significance level.\n\\[\n\\Pr (|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} | H_0 ) = \\alpha_0, \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\Pr (|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 | H_0 ) = \\alpha_1 / 2\n\\tag{3.9}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_r\\) is the the study-specific significance level. The division by two is because half of the false positive rejections are expected to occur in the discordant direction under the null. Also\n\\[\n\\Pr(|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} | H_1) = 1-\\beta_0 \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c_1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 | H_1) \\approx 1-\\beta_1\n\\tag{3.10}\\]\nwhere \\(1-\\beta_r\\) is the study specific power. Power is simple to compute when the alternative is also a single point, but it is more complex when, as in section Section 3.1.3, we consider a distribution of non-null effects. For now, think about \\(1-\\beta_r\\) as an average power. We will return on this point when we discuss hierarchical models.\nThe approximation sign \\(\\approx\\) refers to the fact that we are ignoring the probability that the replication study will generate a significant and discordant effect if the true effect is not null and is indeed in the direction identified in the original study. This probability will be small when the sample size is large or the effect size is large, but can be nontrivial in small studies with small effects.\nRewriting and using independence of the two studies:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\np_{rep} & \\approx\n\\frac{\\Pr(H_1) \\cdot (1-\\beta_0)(1-\\beta_1) + (1- \\Pr(H_1)) \\cdot \\alpha_0 \\alpha_1 / 2}{\\Pr(H_1) \\cdot (1-\\beta_0) + (1-\\Pr(H_1)) \\cdot \\alpha_0} \\\\[10pt]\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.11}\\]\nThe key quantity that remains to understand is \\(\\Pr(H_1)\\), the probability that the effect is not null. The interpretation of this probability depends on the context as well as the analysts’ approach. In section Section 3.2.3 we consider Miller’s version, where \\(\\Pr(H_1)\\) is essentially \\(\\pi\\) from Section Section 3.1.3. Later we will cover an alternative Bayesian interpretation where \\(\\Pr(H_1)\\) is specified based on expert knowledge existing prior to the original experiment.\nWe take two quick digressions before going back to Miller. First, if \\(R&gt;1\\) we can extend this reasoning to more general expressions. For example if we want to estimate the probability of having successful replications in \\(R\\) experiments we can consider \\[\n\\Pr \\left( \\bigcap_{r=1}^R |t_r| &gt; t_{c_r} \\boldsymbol{\\mid} |t_0| &gt; t_{c_0} \\right).\n\\tag{3.12}\\]\nSecond, if you are not familiar with the logic behind Bayes’s rule, we will walk you through it in the remainder of this section. The probability of the event A happening given (\\(|\\)) that B happened is:\n\\[\n\\Pr(A|B) = \\frac{\\Pr(A \\cap B)}{\\Pr(B)}\n\\tag{3.13}\\]\nWhere \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B)\\) is the joint probability that can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(B|A) \\cdot \\Pr(A)\n\\tag{3.14}\\]\nThen the full equation also known as Bayes rule is:\n\\[\n\\Pr(A|B) = \\frac{\\Pr(B|A) \\cdot \\Pr(A)}{\\Pr(B)}\n\\tag{3.15}\\]\n\n3.2.3 Miller’s Aggregate Replication Probability (ARP)\n\nTo recap, Miller (2009) is about replication with the highest precision, because he considers no differences in populations between the experiments. He focuses on tests of hypotheses, and considers replication of experiments with significant testing results, as we did above. He also assumes that power and significance level are the same in the original and replication experiment. He also evaluates power at a single point at a time, effectively assuming that the statistical problem is testing a simple null hypothesis against a simple alternative.\nWith regards to \\(\\Pr( H_1)\\) he considers a scheme similar to that of section Section 3.1.3. A study design is drawn randomly from the aggregate describing a scientific field of interest, and then replicated with high precision. In what proportion of cases does this exercise lead to a replication? For this calculation \\(\\Pr( H_1)\\) is the same as \\(\\pi\\) in Figure 3.1. Miller calls \\(\\pi\\) the strength of a research area. This parameter has also been considered by other authors when evaluating the probability of replication within a research field (Ioannidis, 2005; Wilson & Wixted, 2018).\nIn Miller’s setting, the only relevant parameters in the replication model are the type-2 error rate \\(\\beta\\) (or equivalently the statistical power \\(1 - \\beta\\)), the type-1 error rate \\(\\alpha\\) and the proportion of true hypotheses \\(\\pi\\) in a certain research field.\nUsing formula Equation 3.11, the probability of replicating an effect in a given research area (ARP), conditional on a significant original experiment, is \\[\np_{ARP} \\approx \\frac\n{\\pi \\cdot (1 - \\beta)^2 + (1 - \\pi) \\cdot \\alpha^2 / 2}\n{\\pi \\cdot (1 - \\beta)   + (1 - \\pi) \\cdot \\alpha}\n\\tag{3.16}\\]\n\nThe denominator is the probability of a significant result in the original study, broken down into the probability of a false positive \\((1 - \\pi) \\alpha\\) plus the probability of a true positive \\(\\pi (1 - \\beta)\\). Now, let’s consider the numerator. This is the probability that both the original and replication studies are significant and also concordant in the sign of their effects.\nA good way to understand the process is by formalizing inference using a contingency table as done in Table 3.1.\n\n\nTable 3.1: Inferential process formalized using a contingency table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision on \\(H_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{H_0}\\)\n\n\nFalse\n\n\nTrue Positive (\\(1 - \\beta\\))\n\n\nFalse Negative (\\(\\beta\\))\n\n\n\\(\\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{H_0}\\)\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nFalse Positive (\\(\\alpha\\))\n\n\nTrue Negative (\\(1 - \\alpha\\))\n\n\n\\(1 - \\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the probability that something is significant is the sum of true positives (i.e., the statistical power) and false positives (i.e., type-1 errors) weighted by the prevalence \\(\\pi\\). Thus the numerator \\(\\Pr(|t_1| &gt; t_{c1} \\cap |t_0| &gt; t_{c0})\\) can be written as the sum between:\n\nOriginal study being significant \\((1 - \\beta) \\cdot \\pi + \\alpha \\cdot (1 - \\pi)\\)\n\nReplication study being significant \\((1 - \\beta) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\)\n\n\nWe have \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\) in the second expression because we assume that replication success happens when the effect is in the same direction, i.e., we are ignoring false positives with opposite sign.\nAn interesting use of Equation 3.11 and Equation 3.16 is that we can explore the probability of replication in different scenarios by manipulating the parameters defined above. Ulrich & Miller (2020) improved and extended Miller (2009), by estimating the impact of questionable research practices on the probability of replication. They found that the most important parameter negatively impacting replication rates is \\(\\pi\\), with questionable research practices having only a minor impact.\n\n3.2.4 R Code for the Aggregate replication probability (ARP)\nWe implemented the Miller (2009) equations in R (see also ?arp):\n\narp &lt;- function(R, pi, power, alpha) {\n\n    if(any(R &lt; 2)) stop(\"number of studies should be equal or greater than 2\")\n\n    if(length(power) != 1 & length(power) != R){\n      stop(\"length of power vector should be 1 or R\")\n    }\n\n    if(length(power) == 1) power &lt;- rep(power, R)\n\n    num &lt;- pi * prod(power) + (1 - pi) * alpha * (alpha/2)^(R - 1)\n    den &lt;- pi * power[1] + (1 - pi) * alpha\n    num/den\n}\n\nr is the number of replication studies, pi is \\(\\pi\\), power is \\(1 - \\beta\\) and alpha is \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe Figure 3.4 depicts how the ARP changes as we vary the theory strength \\(\\pi\\) and the power (assumed to be the same for the original and replication experiment).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4\n\n\n\n\nThe main takeaways from Figure 3.4 are:\n\nfor medium (and probably plausible) levels of theory strength \\(\\pi\\), the replication probabilities are relatively low — even when the power is high\nwhen \\(R &gt; 1\\), the replication probabilities are very low — in all conditions\n\n3.2.5 Miller’s Individual replication probability (IRP)\n\nIn contrast to the ARP, which considers a randomly drawn original study from a field, the individual replication probability (IRP) focuses on a specific original study. Miller’s approach is ask what is the probability of a significant and concordant test result in the replication study, pretending that the estimated effect in the original study is correct. The reduces to calculating the power of the replication study conditional at observed effect, that is \\(p_{IRP} = 1 - \\beta(\\hat\\theta_0)\\)\nUsing the Equations from Section 3.2.1, we can reproduce and extend the Miller (2009) figures. Basically, we estimate the IRP assuming that the power (thus the effect size and sample size) of the replication study is the same as that of the original study. The key function is p2d, which returns the power given the effect size for the point estimate and the lower/upper limit of the effect size confidence interval2.\n\np2d &lt;- function(p, n, alpha = 0.05){\n    df &lt;- n*2 - 2\n    to &lt;- abs(qt(p/2, df))\n    se &lt;- sqrt(1/n + 1/n)\n    cit &lt;- effectsize:::.get_ncp_t(to, df)\n    lb.t &lt;- cit[1]\n    ub.t &lt;- cit[2]\n    d &lt;- to * se\n    lb &lt;- lb.t * se\n    ub &lt;- ub.t * se\n    # power\n    d.power &lt;- power.t(d = d, n1 = n, alpha = alpha)\n    lb.power &lt;- power.t(d = lb, n1 = n, alpha = alpha)\n    ub.power &lt;- power.t(d = ub, n1 = n, alpha = alpha)\n    list(t = to, d = d,\n         se = se, df = df,\n         ci.lb = lb, ci.ub = ub,\n         d.power = d.power,\n         lb.power = lb.power,\n         ub.power = ub.power,\n         p = p)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: fig-miller-irp\n\n\n\n\nThe most important takeaway from Figure 3.5 is that the statistical significance of the original experiment alone \\(p_0 \\leq \\alpha\\) is not enough to reliably estimate the probability of replicating the effect. Only when the p-value is very small is the range of expected power relatively narrow. For significant but higher p-values there is a lot of uncertainty vis-á-vis the IRP. In this context, Perugini et al. (2014) have recommended against the use of the point estimate of an effect size to plan a new study (e.g., a replication). A more conservative approach would be to use another value (e.g., the lower bound) of the \\((1 - \\alpha) \\cdot 100\\) confidence interval. This conservative approach can mitigate the likely overestimation of the original study, thus providing a more realistic estimation of the probability of replication.\n\n3.2.6 Bayesian Individual Replication Probability\nMiller’s IRP has two main limitations: first, the effect size estimated in the original study is subject to sampling variability. This is not considered by Miller. In reality, the effect size could be larger or smaller. Second, in scientific areas where finding large effects is more challenging, the true effect size is more likely to be smaller, relative to those estimated for research areas in which large effects abound. So considering the study in isolation is a limitation. Even at the individual level, we should expect a higher probability of replication for research areas where there are more true effects to be found. Some of these limitations can be mitigated by Bayesian replication probabilities. If you are not familiar with the logic behind Bayesian statistics, Lindley (1972) provides an excellent introduction.\nFor a simple example, consider specifying \\(\\Pr(H_1)\\) for the individual experiment at hand to reflect knowledge exisitng up to the point of the original experiment, but not including the original experiment itself. In the depression treatment example, this may have to to with the strength of the hypothesis, the plausibility of treatment examined, prior experiments in animals if the original experiment is in humans etc. Then one can apply the calculus of Section Section 3.2.2 (and specifically Equation 3.16) to evaluate the individual replication probability. Consideration of the sampling variability in the effect size may be incorporated in the specific way one calculates the average power. Consideration of the strength of the field of study can be embedded in the prior, either informally or through the use of hierarchical models as seen later.",

    "section": "\n3.3 Selection and Regression to the Mean",
    "text": "3.3 Selection and Regression to the Mean\nThe original effect size estimation could be biased (usually inflated) for several reasons (e.g., publication bias) affecting the actual probability of replication. For example, let’s assume that original studies are published only when they are significant. In addition, let’s assume we are considering a research area with medium strength and with average medium-small effect sizes (a very likely scenario). Finally, let’s assume we are working with sample sizes that are relatively low. Such a research area will tend to be low-powered; and, significant effects will either be inflated (in the best case) or false positives (in the worst case).\n\nWhen conducting replication studies of these kinds of original studies, we may find significant but substantially smaller estimated effects (or even non significant effects.) For example, the large scale project Collaboration & Open Science Collaboration (2015) reported that — regardless of significance level — replicated effects were substantially smaller than original effects. Regression to the mean is a good explanation of this phenomenon, since selection of extreme results will produce on average lower estimations (i.e., shrinkage) in later studies. In addition, if the replication study design (i.e., sample size) is based on the original effect size estimation, the inflation can greatly reduce the power. This is related to the concept of the type-M (M for magnitude) error (Gelman & Carlin, 2014), which quantifies the exent of inflation given the true effect and the sample size.\nIn Code 3.1, there is a small simulation showing how to estimate the type-M error for a two-sample design.\n\n\n\nCode 3.1: Type-M error simulation for a two-samples design\n\nd &lt;- 0.3\nn &lt;- 50\nnsim &lt;- 1e4\n\ndi &lt;- pi &lt;- rep(NA, nsim)\n\nfor(i in 1:nsim){\n    g0 &lt;- rnorm(n, 0, 1)\n    g1 &lt;- rnorm(n, d, 1)\n    tt &lt;- t.test(g1, g0)\n    di[i] &lt;- tt$statistic * tt$stderr\n    pi[i] &lt;- tt$p.value\n}\n\nsignificant &lt;- pi &lt;= 0.05\nmean(abs(di[significant])) / d\n\n\n\n\n[1] 1.735985\n\n\nThe type-M error increases as the sample size and/or the true effect size decreases.

We simulated two scenarios with a selection for extreme (i.e., significant) values, where the true average effect is zero. In the top panel, we included some heterogeneity — there is a distribution of true effects where the average size is zero. The selection occurs in a hypothetical original study with a sample size of 25. Then, we simulated two other studies with sample sizes 100 and 500, respectively, sampling from the same distribution and with the same true effect. The crucial lesson of Figure 3.7 is that selection of extreme studies will result in replication studies with lower power and smaller estimated effects. This is especially true if the replication study is based on the estimated effect of the original, low-powered study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Regression to the mean. Triangles are significant studies at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) and dots are the non-significant ones. The highlighted effect (in red) is a randomly selected effect that was significant with \\(n = 25\\) participants (original study \\(\\theta_0\\)). We simulated \\(k = 50\\) true effects \\(\\theta_k\\) (in blue) from a Gaussian distribution with mean \\(\\mu_{\\theta = 0}\\) and \\(\\tau^2 = 0.05\\). Then we simulated the first experiment as a comparison of two independent groups, with effect size \\(\\theta_k\\). Then we used the same \\(\\theta_k\\) to simulate another experiment with \\(n = 100\\) and \\(n = 500\\) participants. Clearly, as \\(n\\) increases, the \\(\\theta_k\\) estimation is more precise, with a shrinkage towards the average effect \\(\\mu_\\theta\\).",

    "text": "3.4 Probability of Replication in Extension Experiments\n\n3.4.1 Hierarchical Models\nPawel & Held (2020) generalize the methodology of Miller (2009). Miller’s model neglected the possibility of heterogeneity among true effects, assuming that the power (and thus the effect size) is the same when \\(H_0\\) is false. A more sophisticated way to predict the probability of estimating a certain finding is to use the information of the original study and replication study (one-to-one replication) within a hierarchical bayesian model. Here are two main features of this more general modelling approach:\n\nincludes the uncertainty of both studies and eventually the between-study heterogeneity \\(\\tau\\). This allows the replication study to be truly different from the original study (e.g., it allows us to take the effects of publication bias into account).\nincludes a shrinkage factor, balancing the strength of the original study and the between-study heterogeneity, which allows us to account for regression to the mean and effect size inflation of the original study.\n\nWe adapted the Pawel & Held (2020) model, creating a more general version that can be easily adapted to simulating and analyzing data from replication studies as well as predicting the probability of replication given the model parameters. The generalized version of the model is presented in Figure 3.8. (The actual model will be implemented in Chapter XXX.)\nIn the simple case of a two-group study, where \\(x_{ir}\\) denotes whether individual \\(i\\) is in group one, the distribution of the data in study \\(r\\) is as follows:\n\\[\ny_{ir}|x_{ir} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_r + x_{ir}\\theta_r, \\sigma_r)\n\\]\nIn this case, \\(\\theta_r\\) can be intepreted as the mean difference between the two groups.\nAt the effect size level, for example, we may have:\n\\[\n\\theta_r \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\theta, \\tau)\n\\]\n\nFigure 3.8 depicts the hierarchical model. \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) is the average true effect and \\(\\tau\\) is the heterogeneity thus the standard deviation of the true effects. This is very similar to the generating model presented in Figure 3.1 and can be considered as a standard two-level model (or a random-effects meta-analysis). Both \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) can be associated with a prior distribution. In this case \\(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta_\\theta}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta_\\tau}\\) are vectors of parameters of the prior distributions. A common choice would be a normal distribution for \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) and an half-cauchy distribution for \\(\\tau\\) (Williams et al., 2018). At the study level, \\(\\theta_r\\) is the study-specific slope (i.e., the difference between the groups), \\(\\mu_t\\) is the intercept (i.e., expected value for the reference group). \\(y_{nr}\\) and \\(x_{nr}\\) are the response values and the predictors (respectively) for the individual \\(n\\) of the study \\(r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Hierarchical baysian model for estimating the replication outcome.\n\n\n\n\nThe model can be easily implemented in R using the probabilistic programming language STAN (Stan Development Team, 2021) or, under some conditions, using the analytical form as used in Pawel & Held (2020).",

We purposely omitted defining the outcome of a replication study to dedicate an entire chapter about this topic. The problem of having multiple definitions of replication extends to the various ways of assessing the outcomes of replication studies.\nIn addition, the field of replication metrics keeps growing. Heyard et al.

We decided to make a selection of methods from the database according to the following criteria:\nIn general, despite this heterogeneity in methods and definitions choosing a single measure is probably not the best solution. In fact, large-scale replication projects (e.g., Collaboration & Open Science Collaboration, 2015; Errington et al., 2021; The Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative et al., 2025) always evaluates the results across different metrics.",

When it comes to evaluating the results of the replication studies we can choose between several methods (see Heyard et al., 2024) and some of them are specifically meta-analysis based trying to pool together evidence from original and replication studies. We consider meta-analytic thinking crucial to understand the replication studies and methods but not all methods are strictly meta-analyses in the usual sense.\nIn fact, while the methodology of the initial or replication studies is important when comes to evaluate the single result, at the aggregated level we evaluate how a certain focal parameter (e.g., the difference between two groups or conditions) vary across replications and id there is evidence, whatever the criteria, for a successful replication. Whatever is the model used in the original studies we can essentially think at the aggregated level without loss of generality loss.",

    "text": "4.3 Simulating data\nWhile real-world examples are important, to understand the replication methods from a statistical point of view, simulating simplified examples is a good strategy. Furthermore, simulating data is nowadays considered an important tool to teach and understand statistical methods (Hardin et al., 2015). Monte Carlo simulations are also necessary to estimate statistical properties (e.g., statistical power or type-1 error rate) of complex models.\nFor the simulated examples we can define the following simulation approach:\n\nprimary studies always compare two independent groups on a certain response variable\nwithin a study, the two groups are assumed to come from two normal distributions with unit variance. For one group \\(y_0\\) the mean is centered on zero and for the other group \\(y_1\\) the mean is centered on the value representing the effect size \\(\\theta_r\\) for that specific study.\nthe sample size can vary between the two groups\n\nFor example we can simulate a single study:\n\ntheta &lt;- 0.3\nn0 &lt;- 30\nn1 &lt;- 30\n\ny0 &lt;- rnorm(n0, 0, 1)\ny1 &lt;- rnorm(n1, theta, 1)\n\nmean(y1) - mean(y0) # this is the effect size\n## [1] 0.6006209\nvar(y1)/n1 + var(y0)/n0 # this is the sampling variability\n## [1] 0.07598655\n\n\ndd &lt;- data.frame(y = c(y0, y1),\n                 x = factor(rep(0:1, c(n0, n1))))\n\nggplot(dd, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = x))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can simply iterate the process for \\(R\\) studies to create a series of replications with a common true parameter \\(\\mu_{\\theta}\\). We can also generate a more realistic set of sample sizes sampling from a probability distribution (e.g., Poisson).

Formally:\n\\[\nQ = \\sum_{r = 0}^{R} \\frac{(\\theta_r - \\bar \\theta_R)^2}{\\sigma^2_r}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\bar \\theta_R\\) is the inverse-variance weighted average (i.g., fixed-effect model). The \\(Q\\) statistics is essentially a weighted sum of squares. Under the null hypothesis where all studies are equal \\(\\theta_0 = \\theta_1, ... = \\theta_R\\) the \\(Q\\) statistics has a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with \\(R - 1\\) degrees of freedom. Under the alternative hypothesis the distribution is a non-central \\(\\chi^2\\) with non centrality parameter \\(\\lambda\\). The expected value of the \\(Q\\) is \\(E(Q) = \\nu + \\lambda\\), where \\(\\nu\\) are the degrees of freedom.\nHedges & Schauer proposed to use the \\(Q\\) statistics to evaluate the consistency of a series of replications:\n\nIn case of a replication, \\(\\lambda = 0\\) because \\(\\theta_0 = \\theta_1, ... = \\theta_R\\).\nIn case of an extension, \\(\\lambda &lt; \\lambda_0\\) where \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the maximum value considered equivalent to zero. In other terms, \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the threshold above which the variability is too high for being considered a neglegible quantity for a replication (in Machery, 2020 terms).\n\nThis approach is testing the consistency (i.e., homogeneity) of replications. A successful replication should minimize the heterogeneity and the presence of a significant \\(Q\\) statistics would suggest a failed replication attempt.

Schmidt & Hunter (2014) proposed that when \\(\\tilde{v}\\) is at least 75% of total variance \\(\\tilde{v} + \\tau^2\\) thus \\(\\tau^2\\) could be considered negligible. This corresponds to a \\(I^2 = 25%\\) and a ratio \\(\\frac{\\tau^2}{\\tilde{v}} = 1/3\\) thus \\(\\lambda_0 = \\frac{(R - 1)}{3}\\) can be considered a neglegible heterogeneity.\n\nk &lt;- 100\ndat &lt;- sim_studies(k, 0.5, 0, 50, 50)\nQrep(dat$yi, dat$vi, lambda0 = (k - 1)/3)\n\nQ test for Approximate Replication \n\nQ = 93.881 (df = 99), lambda = 0.000, p = 0.989 \nH0: lambda &lt; 33",

    "section": "\n4.11 Replication Bayes factor",
    "text": "4.11 Replication Bayes factor\nVerhagen & Wagenmakers (2014) proposed a method to estimate the evidence of a replication study. The core topics to understand the method are:\n\nBayesian hypothesis testing using the Bayes Factor (see, Rouder et al., 2009)\n\nBayes Factor using the Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDR, Wagenmakers et al., 2010)\n\n\n\n4.11.1 Bayesian inference\nBayesian inference is the statistical procedure where prior beliefs about a phenomenon are combined, using the Bayes theorem, with evidence from data to obtain the posterior beliefs.\nThe interesting part is that the researcher expresses the prior beliefs in probabilistic terms. Then after collecting data, evidence from the experiment is combined, increasing or decreasing the plausibility of prior beliefs.\nLet’s make an (not very innovative :smile:) example. We need to evaluate the fairness of a coin. The crucial parameter is \\(\\pi\\) that is the probability of success (e.g., head). We have our prior belief about the coin (e.g., fair but with some uncertainty). We toss the coin \\(k\\) times and we observe \\(x\\) heads. What are my conclusions?\n\\[\np(\\pi|D) = \\frac{p(D|\\pi) \\; p(\\pi)}{p(D)}\n\\] Where \\(\\pi\\) is our parameter and \\(D\\) the data. \\(p(\\pi|D)\\) is the posterior distribution that is the product between the likelihood \\(p(D|\\pi)\\) and the prior \\(p(\\pi)\\). \\(p(D)\\) is the probability of the data (aka marginal likelihood) and is necessary only for the posterior to be a proper probability distribution.\nWe can “read” the formula as: The probability of the parameter given the data is the product between the likelihood of the data given the parameter and the prior probability of the parameter.\nLet’s express our prior belief in probabilistic terms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we collect data and we observe \\(x = 40\\) tails out of \\(k = 50\\) trials thus \\(\\hat{\\pi} = 0.8\\) and compute the likelihood:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally we combine, using the Bayes rule, prior and likelihood to obtain the posterior distribution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of the Bayes Factor is computing the evidence of the data under two competing hypotheses, \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) (~ \\(\\pi\\) in our previous example):\n\\[\n\\frac{p(H_0|D)}{p(H_1|D)} = \\frac{f(D|H_0)}{f(D|H_1)} \\times \\frac{p(H_0)}{p(H_1)}\n\\]\nWhere \\(f\\) is the likelihood function, \\(y\\) are the data. The \\(\\frac{p(H_0)}{p(H_1)}\\) is the prior odds of the two hypotheses. The Bayes Factor is the ratio between the likelihood of the data under the two hypotheses.\n\n4.11.2 Bayes Factor using the SDR\nCalculating the BF can be problematic in some conditions. The SDR is a convenient shortcut to calculate the Bayes Factor (Wagenmakers et al., 2010). The idea is that the ratio between the prior and posterior density distribution for the \\(H_1\\) is an estimate of the Bayes factor calculated in the standard way.\n\\[\nBF_{01} = \\frac{p(D|H_0)}{p(D|H_1)} = \\frac{p(\\pi = x|D, H_1)}{p(\\pi = x, H_1)}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\pi\\) is the parameter of interest and \\(x\\) is the null value under \\(H_0\\) e.g., 0. and \\(D\\) are the data.\nFollowing the previous example \\(H_0: \\pi = 0.5\\). Under \\(H_1\\) we use a completely uninformative prior by setting \\(\\pi \\sim Beta(1, 1)\\).\nWe flipped the coin 20 times and we found that \\(\\hat \\pi = 0.75\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ratio between the two black dots is the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.11.3 Verhagen & Wagenmakers (2014) model2\n\nThe idea is using the posterior distribution of the original study as prior for a Bayesian hypothesis testing where:\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\theta_{r} = 0\\) thus there is no effect in the replication study\n\n\\(H_1: \\theta_{r} \\neq 0\\) and in particular is distributed as \\(\\delta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\theta_{0}, \\sigma^2_{0})\\) where \\(\\theta_{0}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{0}\\) are the mean and standard error of the original study\n\nIf \\(H_0\\) is more likely after seeing the data, there is evidence against the replication (i.e., \\(BF_{r0} &gt; 1\\)) otherwise there is evidence for a successful replication (\\(BF_{r1} &gt; 1\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The actual implementation of Verhagen & Wagenmakers (2014) is different (they use the \\(t\\) statistics). We implemented a similar model using a Bayesian linear model with rstanarm.\n\n\nLet’s assume that the original study (\\(n = 30\\)) estimates a \\(\\theta_{0} = 0.4\\) and a standard error \\(\\sigma^2/n\\).\n\n# original study\nn &lt;- 30\nyorig &lt;- 0.4\nse &lt;- sqrt(1/n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe assumption of Verhagen & Wagenmakers (2014) is that the original study performed a Bayesian analysis with a completely flat prior. Thus the confidence interval is the same as the Bayesian credible interval.\n\n\nFor this reason, the posterior distribution of the original study can be approximated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s imagine that a new study tried to replicate the original one.
