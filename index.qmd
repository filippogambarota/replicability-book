# Welcome {.unnumbered}

The aim of this book is to provide a critical and up-to-date overview of the replication problem in science from theoretical, philosophical, and statistical perspectives. Rather than being exhaustive, the book seeks to offer a general framework for understanding and teaching the replication issue in the context of the current reproducibility and replicability crisis.
