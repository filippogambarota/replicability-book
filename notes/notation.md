# top level

$\theta$ = parameter
$\theta^0$ $\theta^1$ hypothesis (no for effect sizes)
$\theta^{0,1}_{i}$
$\pi$ prior ($\gamma$ in miller)
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ (power $1 - \beta$)
roman numerals to observables

# effect sizes

$\theta_{0}$ (the to-be-replicated effect)
$\theta_{r}$ r from 1 to R (R = total)
$\tau$, $\sigma$ (no squared)
another letter for the prior variance
avoid N in pawel paper
prior on tau
$\hat \theta$ in rectangle

general diagram (no distribution)
example diagram with normal

$t$ (for test statistics)
$p$ (for p values)

# questions

- should the sampling variance of the study be on the estimated level and not the true level? should we use also another general notation there?
- usually prior on tau have a single parameters (half cauchy, gamma) or in general we can set something as location and scale
