A natural extension of the previous model where is by including another hierarchical layer where $\mu_{\theta}$ effects are sampled from another distribution. This distribution can be considered as the probability distribution of true effects across a research field. Also the heterogeneity values can be considered as sampled from a probability distribution. In the @fig- we presented the model assuming to have two effects in a given research area. Given a certain ROPE <!-- TODO check if rope is defined --> we have a proportion of true and false effects ($\omega$) for each different effect across a research field.

As an example, a research field could be *clinical psychology* and we can assume to have two effects called the treatment for depression and treatment for anxiety. Then each of these macro-effects have an average true effect $\mu_{\theta}$ and an heterogeneity value. A replication study could target one of the true effects $\theta$. The replication study could be planned as a proper replication where the expected heterogeneity is close to zero or as an extension where the expected heterogeneity depends on the degree of change in fixed-factors and the actual impact on the estimated effect (i.e., *contextual dependency*).
