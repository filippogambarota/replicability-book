# Notes

## @Rosenthal1990-cq

- a replication study that is as close as possible to the original one fails in generalizability (external validity)
- a replication that is less precise (precise means the distance from the original method) improve the generalizability but cannot completely support or disconfirm the original finding

<!-- ADD here a nice figure with the random-effects distribution as theoretical model and the idea of supporting vs extending the original finding -->

- variance of the replications is the degree of similarity with the original experiment

**replication battery**: two replications to overcome the limitation of a single replication study.
    - one that is "exact"
    - the other that is a little bit different

original study d = 0.8

example 1:

replication1: ~0.6
replication2: ~0.6
conclusions: consistent

example 2: 

replication1: 0.10
replication2: -0.10
conclusions: less confidence in the original

example 3:

replication1: 0.60
replication2: 0.20
conclusions: confidence but the result is sensitive to procedural changes (sampling another effect from the distribution)

<!-- IDEA using some sort of IRT to map the distribution of true effects and estimating everything, this can be similar to the generalizability index proposed in the paper -->

- weighting by quality of the methodological procedure
- taking into account the correlation between the experimenters

<!-- IDEA taking into account the correlation between replications. For example the original study and the rep1 are correlated 0.8 and the rep2 is correlated 0.2 (from the authors perspective). The rep2 should be weighted more. -->

- replication diagonal
- coefficient of robusteness of replication. This is the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation. Because the robustness of a research area is measured as the distance from 0 and the variability in replications. In meta-analytical terms tau^2 / mu
