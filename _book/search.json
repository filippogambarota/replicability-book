    "text": "1.1 Replication, Robustness and Reproducibility\nThis book is concerned with what we call the three “R”’s of trustworthy science: Replication, Robustness and Reproducibility. We begin by sketching a definition of each. This first Chapter then elaborates on the definition of replicability more specifically.\nIn 2019 the USA’s National Academies published a report on Reproducibility and Replicability in Science (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine et al., 2019) which we strongly recommend as a complementary reading to this document. They propose to define Replicability as “obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data”. This will be our first “R”. The NAS definition is also endorsed by the American Statistical Association (Broman et al., 2017) and generally adopted in statistics (for example (Heller et al., 2014) add a couple of review papers).\nThe second “R” is Reproducibility, defined by NAS as “obtaining consistent results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, and code, and conditions of analysis” (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine et al., 2019). Here the experimental design, data and methodologies of analysis are all fixed. A reproducible research paper should provide enough information to obtain the results originally reported, starting from the same raw data. Raw data are data in a form as close as possible to what generated the experimental source. Defining precisely what raw data is can be complex both conceptually and practically, but a digression on this would take us too far astray. Nowadays it is becoming more common to supplement a paper with analysis code, raw data (if possible) and details or materials (e.g., experimental stimuli, biological reagents, questionnaires) about the experimental setup. Reproducibility can be considered as the most fundamental pre-requisite of replication in science. Chapter XXX will provide a more detailed explaination of the concept with an overview of tools for doing reproducible science.\nOur third “R” also involves keeping the raw data fixed, and focuses on changing parts of the analysis method. This is different from the previous two, as it investigates the robustness of the results to the many judgment calls that typically need to be made in the implementation of a statistical analysis. Chapter XXX will present some methods for investigating robustness. For example, multiverse analysis is a way to systematically sample different plausible analytical strategies and see their impact on the final conclusions.\nUsage of the first two “R” terms is often inconsistent and is reversed in computer science. (Barba, 2018; Goodman et al., 2016; Kenett & Shmueli, 2015) review these terminologies and their usage.",

    "section": "1.2 Defining Replication",
    "text": "1.2 Defining Replication\n\n1.2.1 Challenges\nWhen studying, planning or conducting studies about replication in science, it is essential to start from a clear definition and formalization of replication. First we need to define when an experiment or study constitutes a replication attempt of another.\nA greay area often arises where scientists attempt to replicate the results of a study using a similar but not identical scientific methodology. If they obtain a different result, should they conclude that the new study did not replicate the original? To answer, the replication needs to be evaluated not only in terms of result but also with regard to the study design, for example with regard to whether experimental factors, approaches and conditions are the same or different. In this first chapter we discuss the design of a replication study from both an empirical and a philosophical perspective.\nThe statistical analysis and the evaluation of whether replication was successful will be covered in Chapter XXX, we’re we will discover that there can be several different definitions of what a successful replication is. Anderson & Kelley (2024) reviewed more than 20 different replication criteria and Heyard et al. (2024) indentified more than 50 published statistical approaches to assess a replication experiment.\nWe begin by reviewing concepts that in our view are general enough to be applied to multiple research areas and translated into an empirically testable statistical framework. The bibliography chapter contains a selected list of theoretical papers on replication.\n\n\n1.2.2 Cronbach’s essential components of an experiment\nWe start by defining the essential components of an experiment as proposed by Cronbach & Shapiro (1982)1 His framework is concisely referred to as UTOS because it consisted of these components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUTOS Framework\n\n\n\n\nUnits: the elements of the population from which the study sample has been drawn; the term population is used here in its statistical meaning: a real or hypothetical universe of units (not necessarily persons) to which the inferential conclusions of the study should apply;\nTreatments: the independent variables, for example experimental interventions, or population subgroups of interest;\nOutcomes: the dependent variables on which the study is focused\nSetting: the remainder of factors that can affect the experimental outcome and its relation to treatments. For example the factors defining the “environment” where a psychological experiment takes place (lab vs online experiment, cultural aspects, etc.)\n\n\n\nSome initial comments:\n\nU: this component positions us unequivocally in the territory of statistical inference, where we posit a population of reference consisting of distinct units, and we are interested in generalizing from an observed sample to the entire population. Naturally not all science aligns with this paradigm. Before reading further, try to think about important scientific studies you may have come across recently that do not fit with this paradigm.\nT & O: these components implicitly assume that the goal of the study was to elucidate how, in the population of interest, the outcomes relate to the independent variables, perhaps causally if the experiment is controlled. Again, this is an important subset of science, but is by no means exhaustive. Clustering, discovery of latent dimensions in high dimensional data, segmentation of images, and a number of other exceptions come to mind. Add your own. Also, important science can be simply exploratory and descriptive, but replicability questions are relevant there as well.\nS: By changing settings “minimally” you get “essentially” the same experiments. For example you may change the temperature in the lab for an experiment where temperature is a negligible factor. On the other hand if you change the temperature in a chemistry experiment where a certain reaction is very sensitive to temperature, you may get a completely different experiment and arguably a different study: skating on ice vs water, so to speak. So it takes a little sprinkle of common sense for this to be a useful definition. Be alert.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Machery’s definition of a replication experiment\nMachery (2020) proposed a simple and flexible perspective on replication called the resampling account.\nConsider an original experiment in the UTOS framework, and imagine we can sharply specify fixed and random factors in the following sense: a random factor can be thought of as sampled from the population of interest, while a fixed factor is not sampled, but rather determined by design. For example, participants (Units) can be assumed to be random when the study samples a group of participants according to a well defined sampling scheme. In contrast, an experimental manipulation is generally fixed. Random sampling affords to option to use statistical inference to learn parameters of the population of interest (see also Yarkoni, 2020 for the idea of generalizability). Stricltly speaking, inference using a fixed factor is limited only to the tested condition. Defining fixed and random factors in real settings can be complex. Challenges and approaches are extensively debated in the literature (e.g., Clark & Linzer, 2015).\nReturning to replication, according to Machery, a replication experiment is an experiment created by sampling from the random factors (e.g., new group of participants), and keeping the non-random factors fixed (e.g., same type of drug or treatment). In this definition, population parameters of interest are identical between an original study and its replication. We will return on this point in Chapter XXX.\nA replication experiment is meant to assess what Machery calls reliability. Machery (2020) uses the term reliability as in measurement theory [] where a reliable instrument (in this case the experiment is seen as the instrument) produces consistent 2 results across different replications of the measurement. When replicating a whole experiment, say sampling a new sample of participants, we are similarly interested in evaluating whether the experimental setup is reliable in the sense of producing consistent results.\nAlong the line of the measurement methaphor, let’s imagine a treatment for depression that have been evaluated in an original study. The researchers developed a protocol, defined the concept of depression, administered the treatment and chosen some depression self-report measures finding a decreasing level of depression compared to the control group. Another group of researchers decided to replicate this original experiment. They adopted the same protocol, definitions and measures but collected another sample of participants from the same population. The results of the replication experiment, for example the magnitude of the effect of the treatment on the depression level as defined by the protocol, may or may not be close to the original. If they are close, this provides evidence in favor of the reliability of the original experiment, as defined above (Nosek & Errington, 2017). Here, we are not questioning the definition or the measures used in the study.\nTo recap the progress made so far, if you can frame a study as UTOS, and clearly separate the random and fixed factors, you know how to design a replication study!",

    "section": "1.3 Validity and Extensions",
    "text": "1.3 Validity and Extensions\n\n1.3.1 Conceptual Replication\nDoes is make sense to compare experiments when fixed factors have changed? In many cases it does, and this type of analysis still falls under the purview of replication, broadly understood. Readers familiar with the replication literature may have noticed that we did not use concepts such as direct or conceptual replication yet. Briefly, a direct replication is usually defined as an experiment that tries to recreate the original experiment as closely as possible. While this can be done in certain fields, most of the time this objective is empirically difficult to achieve to due uncontrollable factors (Nosek & Errington, 2017, 2020). Examples include replicating effects that are strongly culturally related, or experiments that used a completely outdated technology for the experimental setup.\nIn contrast, conceptual replication is a broad term defining a replication experiment with similar aims and methodology but with important differences (e.g., Crandall & Sherman, 2016). In Machery’s terms, a conceptual replication changes some of the fixed factors. In the depression example above, a conceptual replication might be a second experiment using another theoretical definition or measure of depression. Here, the goal is still within the broad umbrella of understanding the effect of the treatment on depression, but the experiment is not a strict replication in the Machery sense, because the outcome measurement methodology has changed. For this reason Machery (2020) uses the term extension. Extensions may include a methodological change but also a more profound philosophical change, for example using a scale motivated by a different theoretical framework for defining depression. An extension experiment is not assessing the reliability, but rather the validity of the original experiment and in a broader sense the theory underlying the original experiment. Similarly to reliability, the term validity is used with measurement theory in mind. The validity of an instrument is the link with the true phenomenon being assessed (for example the actual weight of an object being weighed).\nIn the depression example, if the researchers want to see whether the treatment is effective also using other measures of depression they are extending the original results testing the validity of the result about the treatment.\n\n\n1.3.2 Precision of Replication\nIn practice we can often design a variety of replication / extension experiments, with varying degrees of similarity with the original one. Rosenthal (1990) defines the important concept of precision as the degree of similarity between the replication and the original experiment. The most precise is a Machery replication. Generally, very precise experiments lack external validity (they are not able to extend) but they can directly speak to the reliability of the original experimental setup and results. Less precise experiments reduce the amount of information for assessing the confidence in the original experiment, shifting the focus on the underlying theory. For example, we may say that the treatment reduces also physiological indexes of depression or works also in a different population of patients.\n\n\n1.3.3 Replication vs Extension: different scientific value?\nWe have seen that a precise replication experiment is an attempt to ask again the same inferential question in as close a way as possible. Variations in setting and fixed factors can generate experiments that probe the trustworthiness of the conclusions further. These slight variations are can be successfully analyzed together with replicability in mind, for example in a meta-analysis (see Chapter XXX), even though they do not constitute a strict replication by Machery’s exacting standards.\nAs settings are varied further and the replication becomes less precise, we eventually found ourselves having extended the experimental paradigm beyond the initial goals and populations. When is this line crossed? The answer is dependent on the context and reasonable scientists may disagree about it. An important debate in the literature regards the value of a replication compared to an extension experiment. Crandall & Sherman (2016) considers extensions as more valuable while Simons (2014) argues in favor of focusing on replications experiment. Clearly both have a place in science. If the main aim is to test the reliability of the original experiment one should reduce as much as possible the heterogeneity (i.e., increase the precision). On the other hand, if the aim is to explore different instances of the same effect or theory one should extend the experimental setup. Often an extension experiment is the natural continuation of the scientific line of inquiry opened by a reliable original, possibly with its replication experiment.\nIn the remainder of the discussion we will use precise replication to denote a replication experiment in the strict sense of Machery, or a sufficiently close approximation, while we use the word extension to describe replication settings where the precision is lower. Defining a successful replication, and choosing the appropriate statistical approach for analyzing data can be very different along the precision continuum.\n\n\n1.3.4 Contextual dependency\ncontextual dependency (Gollwitzer & Schwabe, 2022; Inbar, 2016; Van Bavel et al., 2016) further develops the Machery (2020) framework by considering specific weights assigned to each UTOS element. Without going into details, the impact of the different UTOS elements on the actual experiment could differ according to the type of research question. For example, consider a social psychology experiment originally conducted on Western American participants and later extended to European or Asian participants. If the psychological construct of interest is strongly affected by cultural aspects, the impact of changing the ethnicity can be considerable. In contrast a lab-based experiment about low-level perceptual effects may be more portable across the same two population. Our expectations about the replication/extension outcome need to be calibrated on the specific research question and the impact of each experiment element.\n\n\n1.3.5 Investigators as a Factor\nAs a final note, one important but often underestimated problem concerns the investigators conducting the replication study or studies. They can legitimately be considered part of the setting in some cases and random or irrelevant in others. Rosenthal (1990) cleary described the problem of correlated replicators and proposed different weighting approaches, based on the design of the replication study, to replication/extension studies conducted from authors that are orthogonal in terms of background theory and methods. Authors sharing a theory or a strict network of co-authorhips are likely to create experiments and data that are more similar compared to independent authors. A replication or extension study conducted by an independent, and possibly skeptical, researcher should have a greater impact on increasing or decreasing confidence in the original findings compared to a study conducted by the original author.",

    "text": "1 Formalization\n\n1.1 The Miller (2009) definitions\nMiller (2009) proposed one of the earliest probabilistic frameworks for estimating the probability of replication. He defines two different senses of replication probabilities:\n\naggregate replication probability (ARP): the probability of researchers working on a certain research field finding a statistically significant result in a replication study given a significant original study.\nindividual replication probability (IRP): the probability of finding a significant effect on a replication study when replicating a specific original study.\n\nIn this chapter we will take off from Miller’s definitions and provide a formal framework to answer key questions about replication probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey questions\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability of replicating an observed effect in a precise replication experiment?\nWhat is the probability of replicating experiments of a certain type within a research field?\nHow is the probability of replication affected by the experimental design (e.g., sample size, etc.) and by the effect size?\nIs the probability of replication affected by questionable research practices or publication bias?\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Notation\nWe begin by providing a consistent notation and terminology, and a formal framework for the statistical models and analysis examples throughout the book. The notation is based on the replication model by Pawel & Held (2020) and the meta-analytical notation by Hedges & Schauer (2021), Schauer & Hedges (2021), and Hedges & Schauer (2019).\nWe use \\(x\\)’s to denote predictors, treatments, and fixed factors, and \\(y\\)’s to denote outcomes. The subscript \\(i\\) denotes individuals within a study, while \\(r\\) indexes studies. We use \\(r=0\\) to denote the original study, and \\(r = 1, 2, \\ldots, R\\) to denote the \\(R \\geq 1\\) replication studies.\nWe use the greek letter \\(\\theta\\)’s to define the true effects for the original and replication study(s). These are population parameters. In particular \\(\\theta_0\\) is the effect in original study and \\(\\theta_r\\) is the effect in the \\(r\\)-th study. In principle, \\(\\theta\\)’s can be vector valued, but for simplicity we will focus on a scalar effect. We will also use other greek letters for parameters specific to individual settings.\nThe one-to-one replication design is used when a single replication study is replicating an original experiment. On the other hand, a replication project with \\(R\\) replication studies is called a one-to-many design.\nIn Chapter 1 we covered the Machery definition of replication, in which only the randomly drawn subjects differ between the original study and the replications. In a replication of this type, the population of reference remains the same, an therefore \\(\\theta_0 = \\theta_1 = \\ldots = \\theta_R\\). This will be the case with Miller’s original, for example. Generally, in a highly precise replication, this will also be approximately correct.\nOn the other hand, if we consider a group of extension experiments, or even more broadly examine an entire field of research, we typically alter fixed factors, and thus consider many different, albeit related, populations. In this case \\(\\theta\\)’s are no longer identical. Variation between \\(\\theta\\)’s is an important aspect of replicability analysis. We will return to it in several places. For now, consider that this variation depends on the unverse of studies of interest. For example, a group of extension experiment for a specific treatment / outcome combination will generally have smaller variability than a group considering the effect of the same treatment on a variety of outcomes.\n\n1.3 Two-Level Models\nOne way to think about studying the variation of the \\(\\theta\\)’s is to frame the analysis in a two-level model. Within a study, we imagine that subjects are drawn from a population, with each population associated to a specific study design / fixed factors. In turn, then, study designs themselves are seen as draws from a hypothetically vast collection of possible designs. This allows to describe the variation of \\(\\theta\\)’s probabilistically. In many examples we will use a Normal distribution to describe the resulting population of effect sizes. This normal distribution will have mean \\(\\mu_{\\theta}\\) and variance \\(\\tau^2\\).\nReplication is often framed in terms of tests of hypothesis. Parenthetically, several fields of study are making organized attempts at moving scientific reporting away from tests of hypotheses (Harrington et al., 2019). Evidential summaries from hypotheses tests, such as p-values, systematically confound sample size and effect size (Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016). Better reporting focuses on quantitative effect sizes. Nonetheless, replicability analysis requires explicit consideration of significance, as this remains a factor in determining publication.\nHere we will define the null hypothesis to be that “the effect is too small to be of scientific interest”. Formally, the null hypothesis is true when \\(|\\theta| &lt; h_0\\) where \\(h_0\\) is specified by the analyst and defines a so-called region of practical equivalence or ROPE (Kruschke, 2015; Kruschke & Liddell, 2018)1. In a precise replication, \\(\\theta\\) does not change across studies and thus the null hypothesis is either true or not in every study. In contrast, if we consider a group of extension experiments or a whole field, \\(\\theta\\)’s vary and the null hypothesis may hold in some studies and not others. We will use \\(\\pi\\) to denote the proportion of non-null effect in a population of studies.\nMiller (2009) noted that \\(\\pi\\) is an unknown quantity that is difficult to estimate from the literature. In Psychology Wilson & Wixted (2018) tried to estimate \\(\\pi\\) based on the Collaboration & Open Science Collaboration (2015) large scale replication project finding different rates for social and cognitive psychology. On the same line, Jager & Leek (2014) tried to estimate the false discovery rate across the top medical journals.\nThe more precise the replication, the smaller will \\(\\tau\\) be. As \\(\\tau\\) goes to zero, all \\(\\theta\\)’s will concentrate around \\(\\mu_{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\pi\\) will approach either 0 or 1 depending on whether \\(\\mu_{\\theta}\\) is in the region of practical equivalence.\nFigure 3.1 depicts this simple generating model. The idea is that true effects in a given research area \\(\\theta_r\\) comes from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu_theta\\) and standard deviation \\(\\tau\\). Within this research area, we have a certain proportion of true \\(\\pi\\) and false \\(1 - \\pi\\) effects. In case of false effects, we can imagine a ROPE where the effects are considered equivalent to zero. Then these true effects \\(\\theta_r\\) can be the target of an original study \\(\\hat \\theta_0\\) and one or more replication studies \\(\\hat \\theta_r\\) (\\(r = (1, \\ldots, R)\\)). If the study is a precise replication study the heterogeneity is expected to be close to zero while in an extension experiment we are expecting more heterogeneity. To simplify, the expected heterogeneity of a very precise replication is zero and all studies are essentially estimating the same original true effect \\(\\theta_0\\). In case where the heterogeneity is different from zero (i.e., an extension) each replication study is associated with a different underlying true effect \\(\\theta_r\\). The degree of heterogeneity is related to the degree of precision thus the number and relevance of changes to fixed factors. This model can be considered similar to a random-effects meta-analysis (described in Chapter XXX). The model can also be used to simulate replication studies as will be shown in Chapter XXX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: two level generating model\n\n\n\n1.4 Multi-level Model\nThe Figure 3.1 provide an example of a generating model considering a specific research area in the literature. For example, the distribution of true effects related to psychological treatments for depression can be approximated by the model above. Some treatments in some conditions have a higher/lower effect and in other conditions they have a null effect. Extending the same reasoning to multiple effects within a broader literature we can include another hierarchical layer in the model. Figure 3.2 depicts this extended model. To simplify we can have the treatments for depression and anxiety. These research areas have specific average effects \\(\\mu_\\theta^1, \\mu_\\theta^2\\), heterogeneity \\(\\tau^1, \\tau^2\\) and proportions of true \\(\\pi^1, \\pi^2\\) and false \\(1 - \\pi^2, 1 - \\pi^2\\) effects. The combinatons of the two research areas define the broader literature defined as mixture between the two distributions. Each component (i.e., anxiety and depression distributions) is associated with a weight \\(\\omega^1, \\omega^2\\) representing the importance (e.g., prevalence of studies) in the final mixture distribution. As a final note, instead of considering \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) as fixed we can sample these values from two distributions generating a more realistic research area contanining a larger set of true effects. In terms of replication, we can apply the same logic of Figure 3.1 where the degree of precision determine the expected heterogeneity in the replication/extension study.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mixture generating model\n\n\n\n1.5 Simple Null Hypotheses\nMiller (2009) work as well as much work in the literature concerns simple null hypotheses. In our notation the null hypothesis is true when \\(|\\theta| = 0\\). The logic of section Section 3.1.3 can be cloned for this case as well, as illustrated in Figure Figure 3.3. Now the distribution of \\(\\theta\\) has two components: a continuous component describing the variation of the effect assuming the effect is not zero, and a discrete component at exactly zero. The probability of drawing a nonzero effect will again be \\(\\pi\\), which is also the area under the bell curve in the figure. Thus the point mass at zero is \\(1-\\pi\\). In terms of replication, we can apply the same logic of Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 where the degree of precision determine the expected heterogeneity in the replication/extension study.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Point null generating model",

    "text": "2 Probability of Replication in Exact Replication Experiments\n\n2.1 Two-Sample Design Review\nWe will often use a two-sample design to make the discussion more concrete. Assuming the homogeneity of variances among the two groups, the \\(t\\) statistics is calculated as:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2}{SE_{\\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere subscript denote the two groups. The standard error at the denominator is: \\[\n\\mbox{SE}_{\\overline{y}_1 - \\overline{y}_2} = s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(s_p\\) is the pooled standard deviation: \\[\ns_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_{y_1}(n_1 - 1) + s^2_{y_1}{(n_2 - 1)}}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIn the case of a simple null hypothesis, the p-value can be calculated from a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(\\nu = n_1 + n_2 - 2\\) degrees of freedom.\nMore generally, when the true effect size is not zero, the \\(t\\) statistics will follow a non-central Student’s \\(t\\) distribution with \\(\\nu\\) degrees of freedom and \\(\\lambda\\) as non-centrality parameter calculated as: \\[\n\\lambda = \\delta \\sqrt{\\frac{n_1 n_2}{n_1 + n_2}}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta\\) is the true effect size calculated as the true difference between means divided by the true group specific standard error.\nIf \\(F_{t_\\nu}\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the non-central Student’s \\(t\\) distribution, the statistical power is calculated as:\n\\[\n1 - \\beta = 1 - F_{t_\\nu} \\left(t_c, \\lambda \\right) + F_{t_\\nu} \\left(-t_{c}, \\lambda \\right)\n\\tag{5}\\]\nWith this setup, we can easily implement these equations in R creating a flexible set of functions to reproduce and extend the examples from the Miller (2009) work.\n\npower.t &lt;- function(d, n1, n2 = NULL, alpha = 0.05){\n    if(is.null(n2)) n2 &lt;- n1\n    df  &lt;- n1 + n2 - 2\n    ncp &lt;- d * sqrt((n1 * n2) / (n1 + n2))\n    tc  &lt;- abs(qt(alpha/2, df = df))\n    pt(-tc, df = df, ncp = ncp) + pt(tc, df = df, ncp = ncp, lower.tail = FALSE)\n}\n\n\npower.t(d = 0.5, n1 = 30)\n## [1] 0.4778965\npower.t(d = 0.5, n1 = 100)\n## [1] 0.9404272\npower.t(d = 0.1, n1 = 200)\n## [1] 0.1694809\n\nWhen the null hypothesis is a set (section Section 3.1.3) the p-value is calculated conditional of the least favorable case, which occurs when \\(\\theta = h_0\\) or \\(\\theta = - h_0\\) so the noncentral \\(t\\) is used to compute both the p-value and the power.\nAnother possibility is to use the full ROPE for the statistical test within the so-called equivalence testing framework (Lakens et al., 2018; see also Goeman et al., 2010 for the three-sided hypothesis testing).\n\n2.2 The Calculus of Replication Probabilities\nConsider the case of strict replication, so the null hypothesis is true or falls in both studies at the same time.\nTo prepare for Miller (2009), we look at replication probability by focusing on replicating significance. Given that the original study was significant (that is that \\(|t_0| &gt; t_{c_0}\\)), what is the probability that the second study will also be significant and the effect will be in the same direction as the original study? Formally we express significance in the original study as \\(|t_0| &gt; t_{c_0}\\), significance in the replication study as \\(|t_1| &gt; t_{c_1}\\), and concordance of the direction of the effect as \\(t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt; 0\\).\n\\[\np_{rep} = \\Pr(|t_1| &gt; t_{c_1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 \\boldsymbol{\\mid} |t_0| &gt; t_{c_0})\n\\tag{6}\\]\nUsing the laws of conditional and total probability in turn, We can express this as\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\np_{rep} &= \\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c_1} \\boldsymbol{\\mid} |t_0| \\geq t_{c_0}) \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\frac{\\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c_1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 \\cap |t_0| \\geq t_{c_0})}{\\Pr(|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0})} \\\\[10pt]\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nConsiderering separately the numerator and the denominator, and using the law of total probabilities, We have:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mbox{numerator} =& \\Pr(H_1) \\cdot \\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 \\cap |t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} \\mid H_1) + \\\\\n& \\Pr(H_0) \\cdot \\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 \\cap |t_0| \\geq t_{c0} \\mid H_0) \\\\[10pt]\n\\mbox{denominator} =& \\Pr(H_1) \\cdot \\Pr(|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} \\mid H_1) + \\\\\n& \\Pr(H_0) \\cdot \\Pr(|t_0| \\geq t_{c_1} \\mid H_0).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nThese expressions are a bit lengthy but allow us to express the probability of replication as a useful function of power and significance level.\n\\[\n\\Pr (|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} | H_0 ) = \\alpha_0, \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\Pr (|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 | H_0 ) = \\alpha_1 / 2\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_r\\) is the the study-specific significance level. The division by two is because half of the false positive rejections are expected to occur in the discordant direction under the null. Also\n\\[\n\\Pr(|t_0| \\geq t_{c_0} | H_1) = 1-\\beta_0 \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\Pr(|t_1| \\geq t_{c_1} \\cap t_0 \\cdot t_1 &gt;0 | H_1) \\approx 1-\\beta_1\n\\tag{10}\\]\nwhere \\(1-\\beta_r\\) is the study specific power. Power is simple to compute when the alternative is also a single point, but it is more complex when, as in section Section 3.1.3, we consider a distribution of non-null effects. For now, think about \\(1-\\beta_r\\) as an average power. We will return on this point when we discuss hierarchical models.\nThe approximation sign \\(\\approx\\) refers to the fact that we are ignoring the probability that the replication study will generate a significant and discordant effect if the true effect is not null and is indeed in the direction identified in the original study. This probability will be small when the sample size is large or the effect size is large, but can be nontrivial in small studies with small effects.\nRewriting and using independence of the two studies:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\np_{rep} & \\approx\n\\frac{\\Pr(H_1) \\cdot (1-\\beta_0)(1-\\beta_1) + (1- \\Pr(H_1)) \\cdot \\alpha_0 \\alpha_1 / 2}{\\Pr(H_1) \\cdot (1-\\beta_0) + (1-\\Pr(H_1)) \\cdot \\alpha_0} \\\\[10pt]\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nThe key quantity that remains to understand is \\(\\Pr(H_1)\\), the probability that the effect is not null. The interpretation of this probability depends on the context as well as the analysts’ approach. In section Section 3.2.3 we consider Miller’s version, where \\(\\Pr(H_1)\\) is essentially \\(\\pi\\) from Section Section 3.1.3. Later we will cover an alternative Bayesian interpretation where \\(\\Pr(H_1)\\) is specified based on expert knowledge existing prior to the original experiment.\nWe take two quick digressions before going back to Miller. First, if \\(R&gt;1\\) we can extend this reasoning to more general expressions. For example if we want to estimate the probability of having successful replications in \\(R\\) experiments we can consider \\[\n\\Pr \\left( \\bigcap_{r=1}^R |t_r| &gt; t_{c_r} \\boldsymbol{\\mid} |t_0| &gt; t_{c_0} \\right).\n\\tag{12}\\]\nSecond, if you are not familiar with the logic behind Bayes’s rule, we walk you through it in the remainder of this section. The probability of the event A happening given (\\(|\\)) that B happened is:\n\\[\n\\Pr(A|B) = \\frac{\\Pr(A \\cap B)}{\\Pr(B)}\n\\tag{13}\\]\nWhere \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B)\\) is the joint probability that can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(B|A) \\cdot \\Pr(A)\n\\tag{14}\\]\nThen the full equation also known as Bayes rule is:\n\\[\n\\Pr(A|B) = \\frac{\\Pr(B|A) \\cdot \\Pr(A)}{\\Pr(B)}\n\\tag{15}\\]\n\n2.3 Miller’s Aggregate Replication Probability (ARP)\n\nTo recap, Miller (2009) original work is about replication with the highest precision, because he considers no differences in populations between the experiments. He focuses on tests of hypotheses, and considers replication of experiments with significant testing results, as we did above. He also assumes that power and significance level are the same in the original and replication experiment. He also evaluates power at a single point at a time, effectively assuming that the statistical problem is testing a simple null hypothesis against a simple alternative.\nWith regards to \\(\\Pr( H_1)\\) he considers a scheme similar to that of section Section 3.1.3. A study design is drawn randomly from the aggregate describing a scientific field of interest, and then replicated with high precision. In what proportion of times does this exercise lead to a replication? For this calculation \\(\\Pr( H_1)\\) is the same as \\(\\pi\\) in Figure 3.1. Miller calls \\(\\pi\\) the strenght of a research area. This parameter has also been considered by other author when evaluating the probability of replicating in a research field (Ioannidis, 2005; Wilson & Wixted, 2018).\nIn his setting, the only relevant parameters in his replication model are the type-2 error rate \\(\\beta\\) (or equivalently the statistical power \\(1 - \\beta\\)), the type-1 error rate \\(\\alpha\\) and the proportion of true hypotheses \\(\\pi\\) in a certain research field.\nUsing formula Equation 3.11, the probability to replicate an effect in a given research area, or ARP, conditional on a significant original experiment is \\[\np_{ARP} \\approx \\frac\n{\\pi \\cdot (1 - \\beta)^2 + (1 - \\pi) \\cdot \\alpha^2 / 2}\n{\\pi \\cdot (1 - \\beta)   + (1 - \\pi) \\cdot \\alpha}\n\\tag{16}\\]\n\nThe denominator is the probability of a significant results in the original study, broken down into the probability of a false false positive \\((1 - \\pi) \\alpha\\) plus the probability of a true positive \\(\\pi (1 - \\beta)\\). Now, let’s consider the numerator. This is the probability that both the original and replication studies being significant and also concordant in the sign of the effect.\nA good way to understand the process is by formalizing inference using a contingency table as done in Table 3.1.\n\n\nTable 1: Inferential process formalized using a contingency table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision on \\(H_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{H_0}\\)\n\n\nFalse\n\n\nTrue Positive (\\(1 - \\beta\\))\n\n\nFalse Negative (\\(\\beta\\))\n\n\n\\(\\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{H_0}\\)\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nFalse Positive (\\(\\alpha\\))\n\n\nTrue Negative (\\(1 - \\alpha\\))\n\n\n\\(1 - \\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the probability that something is significant is the sum of true positives (i.e., the statistical power) and false positives (i.e., type-1 errors) weighted by the prevalence \\(\\pi\\). Thus the numerator \\(\\Pr(|t_1| &gt; t_{c1} \\cap |t_0| &gt; t_{c0})\\) can be written as the sum between:\n\nOriginal study being significant \\((1 - \\beta) \\cdot \\pi + \\alpha \\cdot (1 - \\pi)\\)\n\nReplication study being significant \\((1 - \\beta) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\) because we assume that the replication success happens when the result is on the same direction thus we are not considering false positives with the opposite sign.\nAn interesting use of Equations Equation 3.11 and Equation 3.16 is that we can explore the probability of replication in different scenarios manipulating the parameters defined above. Ulrich & Miller (2020) improved and extended the Miller (2009) work estimating the impact of questionable research practices on the probability of replication. They found that the crucial parameter for reducing the replication rates is probably \\(\\pi\\) and with a minor impact of questionable research practices.\n\n2.4 R Code for the Aggregate replication probability (ARP)\nWe implemented the Miller (2009) equations in R (see also ?arp):\n\narp &lt;- function(R, pi, power, alpha) {\n  \n    if(any(R &lt; 2)) stop(\"number of studies should be equal or greater than 2\")\n    \n    if(length(power) != 1 & length(power) != R){\n      stop(\"length of power vector should be 1 or R\")\n    }\n    \n    if(length(power) == 1) power &lt;- rep(power, R)\n  \n    num &lt;- pi * prod(power) + (1 - pi) * alpha * (alpha/2)^(R - 1)\n    den &lt;- pi * power[1] + (1 - pi) * alpha\n    num/den\n}\n\nr is the number of replication studies, pi is \\(\\pi\\), power is \\(1 - \\beta\\) and alpha is \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe Figure 3.4 depicts how the ARP change according to the theory strength \\(\\pi\\) and the power (assumed to be the same for the original and replication experiment).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\nThe main takeaways from Figure 3.4 are:\n\nfor medium (and probably plausible) levels of theory strength \\(\\pi\\) the replication probabilities are relatively low even the power is high\nwhen \\(R &gt; 1\\) the probabilities are very low in every conditions\n\n2.5 Miller’s Individual replication probability (IRP)\n\nIn contrast to the ARP, which considers a randomly drawn original study from a field, the individual replication probability (IRP) focuses on a specific original study. Miller’s approach is ask what is the probability of a significant and concordant test result in the replication study, pretending that the estimated effect in the original study is correct. The reduces to calculating the power of the replication study conditional at observed effect, that is \\(p_{IRP} = 1 - \\beta(\\hat\\theta_0)\\)\nUsing Equations from the Section 3.2.1 we can reproduce and extend the Miller (2009) figures. Basically we estimate the IRP assuming the power (thus the effect size and sample size) of the replication study is the same of the original study. The core is the p2d function that return the power given the effect size for the point estimate and the lower/upper limit of the effect size confidence interval2.\n\np2d &lt;- function(p, n, alpha = 0.05){\n    df &lt;- n*2 - 2\n    to &lt;- abs(qt(p/2, df))\n    se &lt;- sqrt(1/n + 1/n)\n    cit &lt;- effectsize:::.get_ncp_t(to, df)\n    lb.t &lt;- cit[1]\n    ub.t &lt;- cit[2]\n    d &lt;- to * se\n    lb &lt;- lb.t * se\n    ub &lt;- ub.t * se\n    # power\n    d.power &lt;- power.t(d = d, n1 = n, alpha = alpha)\n    lb.power &lt;- power.t(d = lb, n1 = n, alpha = alpha)\n    ub.power &lt;- power.t(d = ub, n1 = n, alpha = alpha)\n    list(t = to, d = d,\n         se = se, df = df,\n         ci.lb = lb, ci.ub = ub,\n         d.power = d.power,\n         lb.power = lb.power,\n         ub.power = ub.power,\n         p = p)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: fig-miller-irp\n\n\n\n\nThe most important point from Figure 3.5 is that statistical significance alone \\(p_0 \\leq \\alpha\\) of the original experiment is not enough to reliably estimate the probability of replicating that effect. Only when the p-value is very small the range of expected power is relatively narrow. For significant but higher p-values there is a lot of uncertainty in terms of IRP. In this context, Perugini et al. (2014) suggested to use not the point estimate of an effect size to plan a new study (e.g., a replication). A more conservative approach could use another value (e.g., the lower bound) of the \\((1 - \\alpha) \\cdot 100\\) confidence interval. This conservative approach could mitigate the likely overestimation of the original study providing a more realistic estimation of the probability of replication.\n\n2.6 Bayesian Individual Replication Probability\nMiller’s IRP has two main limitations: first, the effect size estimated in the original study is subject to sampling variability. This is not considered. In reality the effect size could be larger or smaller. Second, in scientific areas where finding large effects is more challenging, the true effect size is more likely to be smaller than that estimated compared to areas where large effects abound. So considering the study in isolation is a limitation. Even at the individual level, we should have an higher probability of replication for research areas where there are more true effects. Some of these limitation can be mitigated by Bayesian replication probabilities. If you are not familiar with the logic behind Bayesian statistics Lindley (1972) provides a great introduction.\nFor a simple example consider specifying \\(\\Pr(H_1)\\) for the individual experiment at hand to reflect knowledge exisitng up to the point of the original experiment, but not including the original experiment itself. In the depression treatment example this may have to to with the strength of the hypothesis, the plausibility of treatment examined, prior experiments in animals if the original experiment is in humans etc. Then you can apply the calculus of Section Section 3.2.2 and specifically Equation 3.16 to evaluate the individual replication probability. Consideration of the sampling variability in the effect size would be incorporated in the specific way you would calculate the average power. Consideration of the strenght of the field of study would be embedded to the prior, either informally or through the use of hierarchical models as seen later.",

    "section": "\n3 Selection and Regression to the Mean",
    "text": "3 Selection and Regression to the Mean\nThe original effect size estimation could be biased (usually inflated) for several reasons (e.g., publication bias) affecting the actual probability of replication. For example, let’s assume that original studies are published only when they are significant. In additions let’s assume working on a research area with medium strength and on average medium-small effects (a very likely scenario). Then let’s also assume to work with sample sizes that are relatively low. This research area will be on average low-powered and significant effects will be in the best case inflated and in the worst case false positives.\n\nWhen conducting replication studies of these original works sometimes can happen to find significant but substantially lower estimated effects or even non significant effects. For example, the large scale project Collaboration & Open Science Collaboration (2015) reported that regardless the significance, replicated effect where substantially lower than original effects. Regression to the mean is a good explanation for this phenomenon because selection of extreme results will produce on average lower estimations (i.e., shrinkage) in later studies. In addition, if the replication study design (i.e., sample size) is based on the original effect size estimation the inflation can greatly reduce the power. This is related to the concept of the type-M (M for magnitude) error (Gelman & Carlin, 2014) that quantify the exent of inflation given the true effect and the sample size.\nIn the Code 3.1 there is a small simulation showing how to estimate the type-M error for a two-samples design.\n\n\n\nCode 1: Type-M error simulation for a two-samples design\n\nd &lt;- 0.3\nn &lt;- 50\nnsim &lt;- 1e4\n\ndi &lt;- pi &lt;- rep(NA, nsim)\n\nfor(i in 1:nsim){\n    g0 &lt;- rnorm(n, 0, 1)\n    g1 &lt;- rnorm(n, d, 1)\n    tt &lt;- t.test(g1, g0)\n    di[i] &lt;- tt$statistic * tt$stderr\n    pi[i] &lt;- tt$p.value\n}\n\nsignificant &lt;- pi &lt;= 0.05\nmean(abs(di[significant])) / d\n\n\n\n\n[1] 1.74088\n\n\nThe type-M error increases as the sample size and/or the true effect size decreases.

We simulated two scenarios with a selection for extreme values (i.e., significant) where the true average effect is zero. In the top panel we simulated some heterogeneity thus there is a distribution of true effects where the average is zero. The selection occurs in an hypothetical original study with a sample size of 25. Then, we simulated other two studies with sample size 100 and 500 sampling from the same distribution and in the case of heterogeneous effect using the same true effect. The crucial point from Figure 3.7 is that selection of extreme studies will bring to replication studies with lower power and lower estimated effects. This is especially true if the replication study is based on the estimated effect of the original low-powered study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Regression to the mean. Triangles are significant studies at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) and dots are the non-significant ones. The highlighted effect (in red) is a randomly selected effect that was significant with \\(n = 25\\) participants (original study \\(\\theta_0\\)). We simulated \\(k = 50\\) true effects \\(\\theta_k\\) (in blue) from a Gaussian distribution with mean \\(\\mu_{\\theta = 0}\\) and \\(\\tau^2 = 0.05\\). Then we simulated the first experiment as a two independent groups comparison with effect size \\(\\theta_k\\). Then we used the same \\(\\theta_k\\) to simulate another experiment with \\(n = 100\\) and \\(n = 500\\) participants. Clearly, as \\(n\\) increase, the \\(\\theta_k\\) estimation is more precise with a shrinkage towards the average effect \\(\\mu_\\theta\\).",

We adapted the Pawel & Held (2020) model creating a more general version that can be easily declined for simulating and analyzing data from replication studies as well as predicting the probability of replication given the model parameters. The generalized version of the presented in Figure 3.8.\nIn the simple case of a two-groups study where \\(x_{ir}\\) denotes whether individual \\(i\\) is in group one, the distribution of the data in study \\(r\\) is as follows:\n\\[\ny_{ir}|x_{ir} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_r + x_{ir}\\theta_r, \\sigma_r)\n\\]\nIn this case \\(\\theta_r\\) can be intepreted as the mean difference between the two groups.\nAt the effect size level, for example, we may have:\n\\[\n\\theta_r \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\theta, \\tau)\n\\]\n\nFigure 3.8 depicts the hierarchical model. \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) is the average true effect and \\(\\tau\\) is the heterogeneity thus the standard deviation of the true effects. This is very similar to the generating model presented in Figure 3.1 and can be considered as a standard two-level model or random-effects meta-analysis. Both \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) can be associated with a prior distribution. In this case \\(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta_\\theta}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta_\\tau}\\) are vectors of parameters of the prior distributions. A common choice could be a normal distribution for \\(\\mu_\\theta\\) and an half-cauchy distribution for \\(\\tau\\) (Williams et al., 2018). At the study level, \\(\\theta_r\\) is study specific slope (i.e., the difference between the groups), \\(\\mu_t\\) is the intercept (i.e., expected value for the reference group). \\(y_{nr}\\) and \\(x_{nr}\\) are respectively the response values and the predictors for the individual \\(n\\) of the study \\(r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Hierarchical baysian model for estimating the replication outcome.\n\n\n\n\nThe model can be easily implemented in R using the probabilistic programming language STAN (Stan Development Team, 2021) or, under some conditions, using the analytical form as used in Pawel & Held (2020).",

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nAnderson & Kelley (2024) suggests that also the perspective of supporting the null hypothesis should be taken into account especially when we are really skeptical about the initial results. We want to replicate an effect to see the reliability, maybe better estimating the true effect with a larger sample (taking into account the inflation of the original effect) but we could also think that the original effect is a false positive and we want to do the replication to see if the null hypothesis is supported. The bayes factor approach by Ly et al. (2019) Verhagen & Wagenmakers (2014) is exactly about this. also equivalence testing is useful\nIn the previous chapters we introduced replication from a statistical and theoretical point of view. We purposely omitted defining the outcome of a replication study to dedicate an entire chapter about this part. Similarly to the multiple definitions problem there are several statistical measures for the replication assessment. There are also multiple ways to propose a classification but we could indentify:\nIn addition to the multitude of methods, the field of replication measures is relatively new and keep growing proposing new metrics, simulation studies, and comparisons between methods. A review work could be in principle the best option but this is not feasible and also useful for a very active research area. There is an amazing project proposed by Heyard et al. (2024) where an extensive systematic review is supported by an online and keep up-to-date database with all replication measures organized and classified according to a common methodology. The authors reviewed roughly 50 different measures. The database is avaliable at the following link http://rachelheyard.com/reproducibility_metrics/.\nWe decided to make a selection of methods from the database according to the following criteria:",
