## index.qmd

- Line 4: TODO expand this section a little bit 
- Line 8: TODO describe book contents and chapters here 
- Line 12: The book is written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). All materials and source code GitHub. The main language used in the statistical part of the book is [R](https://www.r-project.org/). In addition, we wrote several functions used in the examples collected into an R package  TODO put R package name  used through the book. You are free to fork, share and reuse contents. In addition, we consider the book as a shared resources thus if you have some suggestions, additions or any way to extend or improve the content you can submit a pull request on Github or contact the author (see the @sec-contributing section). 
- Line 18: TODO study a little bit how the PR method could work 

## chapters/_chapter4-source.qmd

- Line 0: TODO:  table with method (rows), (colums)properties, id exact or extension, bayesian or not, open source code, citation 
- Line 11: TODO check the final table and the overall structure of the paper because it's great also the references are amazing 
- Line 32: TODO the idea here is also to keep track of the methods providing a clear overview 
- Line 107: While real-world examples are important, to understand the replication methods from a statistical point of view, simulating simplified examples is a good strategies. Furthermore, simulating data is nowadays considered an important tool to teach and understand statistical methods  TODO add reference about simulating for learning . In additions, Monte Carlo simulations are necessary to estimate statistical properties (e.g., statistical power or type-1 error rate) of complex models. 

## chapters/chapter5.qmd

- Line 736: TODO fix the image, ggplot version 
- Line 905: TODO fix the image, ggplot version 
- Line 932: TODO fix the image, ggplot version

## chapters/changelog.qmd

- Line 0: TODO adapt a changelog strategy as lakens https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/changelog.html 

## chapters/chapter3.qmd

- Line 249: TODO: review and smooth this section 
- Line 265: TODO see if the remainder of the section can be shortened, it seems a bit repetitive 
- Line 356: TODO: review and smooth this section 
- Line 408: GIOVANNI: i have added a small section and simulation about typeM error by gelman. I think that is interesting because shows the amount of effect size inflation given the sample size when selecting for significance 
- Line 715: TODO: describe standardized vs unstandardized 
- Line 719: GIOVANNI: is sigma the residual variance or the effect size sampling variability? 

## chapters/glossary.qmd

- Line 0: TODO put better this glossary maybe using the https://debruine.github.io/quarto-glossary/ package
