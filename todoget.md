## index.qmd

- Line 4: TODO expand this section a little bit 
- Line 8: TODO describe book contents and chapters here 
- Line 12: The book is written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). All materials and source code GitHub. The main language used in the statistical part of the book is [R](https://www.r-project.org/). In addition, we wrote several functions used in the examples collected into an R package  TODO put R package name  used through the book. You are free to fork, share and reuse contents. In addition, we consider the book as a shared resources thus if you have some suggestions, additions or any way to extend or improve the content you can submit a pull request on Github or contact the author (see the @sec-contributing section). 
- Line 18: TODO study a little bit how the PR method could work 

## chapters/_chapter4-source.qmd

- Line 0: TODO:  table with method (rows), (colums)properties, id exact or extension, bayesian or not, open source code, citation 
- Line 11: TODO check the final table and the overall structure of the paper because it's great also the references are amazing 
- Line 32: TODO the idea here is also to keep track of the methods providing a clear overview 
- Line 107: While real-world examples are important, to understand the replication methods from a statistical point of view, simulating simplified examples is a good strategies. Furthermore, simulating data is nowadays considered an important tool to teach and understand statistical methods  TODO add reference about simulating for learning . In additions, Monte Carlo simulations are necessary to estimate statistical properties (e.g., statistical power or type-1 error rate) of complex models. 

## chapters/chapter5.qmd

- Line 736: TODO fix the image, ggplot version 
- Line 905: TODO fix the image, ggplot version 
- Line 932: TODO fix the image, ggplot version 

## chapters/chapter4.qmd

- Line 0: TODO:  table with method (rows), (colums)properties, id exact or extension, bayesian or not, open source code, citation 
- Line 12: TODO check the final table and the overall structure of the paper because it's great also the references are amazing 
- Line 33: TODO the idea here is also to keep track of the methods providing a clear overview 
- Line 59: An important point is related to the choice of the method when evaluating a replication result. The @Heyard2024-hv work shows the amount of different methods and definitions of replication success without formally comparing them. This is not a problematic aspect because in practice, large scale replication projects such as the  TODO add the references  used different methods for the same dataset. In this context is important clearly use the method, and the related replication definition, closest to our aim. 
- Line 105: While real-world examples are important, to understand the replication methods from a statistical point of view, simulating simplified examples is a good strategies. Furthermore, simulating data is nowadays considered an important tool to teach and understand statistical methods  TODO add reference about simulating for learning . In additions, Monte Carlo simulations are necessary to estimate statistical properties (e.g., statistical power or type-1 error rate) of complex models. 
- Line 118: TODO add more notation here 
- Line 281: The main improvement of confidence/prediction interval methods is taking into account the size of the effect and the precision. The confidence interval represent the sampling uncertainty around the estimated value. It is interpreted as the percentage of confidence intervals under repetition of the same sampling procedure that contains the true value.  TODO check better definition 

## chapters/changelog.qmd

- Line 0: TODO adapt a changelog strategy as lakens https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/changelog.html 

## chapters/chapter3.qmd

- Line 249: TODO: review and smooth this section 
- Line 265: TODO see if the remainder of the section can be shortened, it seems a bit repetitive 
- Line 356: TODO: review and smooth this section 
- Line 408: GIOVANNI: i have added a small section and simulation about typeM error by gelman. I think that is interesting because shows the amount of effect size inflation given the sample size when selecting for significance 
- Line 715: TODO: describe standardized vs unstandardized 
- Line 719: GIOVANNI: is sigma the residual variance or the effect size sampling variability? 

## chapters/glossary.qmd

- Line 0: TODO put better this glossary maybe using the https://debruine.github.io/quarto-glossary/ package
