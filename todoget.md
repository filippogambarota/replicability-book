## chapters/chapter3.qmd

- Line 242: TODO: review and smooth this section 
- Line 258: TODO see if the remainder of the section can be shortened, it seems a bit repetitive 
- Line 349: TODO: review and smooth this section 
- Line 401: GIOVANNI: i have added a small section and simulation about typeM error by gelman. I think that is interesting because shows the amount of effect size inflation given the sample size when selecting for significance 
- Line 708: TODO: describe standardized vs unstandardized 
- Line 712: GIOVANNI: is sigma the residual variance or the effect size sampling variability? 

## chapters/_chapter4-source.qmd

- Line 0: TODO:  table with method (rows), (colums)properties, id exact or extension, bayesian or not, open source code, citation 
- Line 11: TODO check the final table and the overall structure of the paper because it's great also the references are amazing 
- Line 32: TODO the idea here is also to keep track of the methods providing a clear overview 
- Line 107: While real-world examples are important, to understand the replication methods from a statistical point of view, simulating simplified examples is a good strategies. Furthermore, simulating data is nowadays considered an important tool to teach and understand statistical methods  TODO add reference about simulating for learning . In additions, Monte Carlo simulations are necessary to estimate statistical properties (e.g., statistical power or type-1 error rate) of complex models. 

## chapters/glossary.qmd

- Line 0: TODO put better this glossary maybe using the https://debruine.github.io/quarto-glossary/ package 

## chapters/changelog.qmd

- Line 0: TODO adapt a changelog strategy as lakens https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/changelog.html
